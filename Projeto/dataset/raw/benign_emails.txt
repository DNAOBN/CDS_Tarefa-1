The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of 
tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.  He is 
buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.  If you are interested in the 
9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you 
for $305.  Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the 
weekend.  You can reach me at work or anytime this weekend on my cell phone.  
If you are interested please call me at 713-853-5933 (work) or 713-516-8820 
(cell) and we will work it out.  FYI - I am also notifying the person who bid 
$305 and promised to give them first look but otherwise the tickets are your 
if you want.

Thanks,

Martin

Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term 
shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 
under this year
and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for 
were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings 
based on where
the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next 
summer to be trading over $4.55

I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.  
The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 
and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation 
from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.  
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks 
like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried 
about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical 
moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.  
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get 
tropical  moisture.

Cheryl, I was in your store on 9/23/00 and saw some Bernhardt furniture I am 
interested in.  It is the Paris Collection Dining Table and Chairs and the 
numbers are:

346-242  Table
346-244  Base
346-502  Air Chair (4)
346-501  Side Chair

Also I am interested in one of the two beds in the Paris Collection:

346-435  Sleigh Bed 5-0

346-527  Metal Canopy 5-0
346-457  Poster Bed 5-0
346-416  Poster Headboard 4-6 thru 5-0

On the second bed I am not sure if you need all three pieces or not so it 
would help if you could tell me what is the difference between the three 
pieces.  Finally, I am interested in an amroire and chest of draws (there are 
several depending if I go with a granite top or not):
346-144  Armoire
346-237  Right Stone Top
346-236  Right Bachelor's Chest Base
346-235  Right Bachelor'e Chest
346-042  Dressing Chest
346-044  Dressing Chest Stone Top
346-043  Dressing Chest Base

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.  If it is easier you can email 
me with the prices and then call to go over the info (instead of having to 
give 15 prices).  My work number is 713-853-5933.

Thanks,

Martin Cuilla

Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is 
still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already).  
Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going 
to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed 
to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other 
things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also 
I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from 
Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but 
wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  

Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me 
know.

Love

Hubby

Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this 
year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have 
until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You 
should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points 
you want to bid.  You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone 
bids 1 point you will lose.  In the case of a tying bid the two teams will 
have an open bid to determine who gets the player.  Everyone will start with 
100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for 
highest score and 12 points for lowest score).

Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you 
should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I 
looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low 
Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with 
energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I 
don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up 
your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I 
don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look 
at some options when you are here for the wedding.

As we discussed, the date that Ken thinks is best for the United Way Kick-off 
is August 9 at the conclusion of the Employee Meeting.  He thinks it would be 
fine to do the presentations there and then move on to whatever activity is 
planned.

Thanks for everyone's patience.

Hi Jeanine -

I have checked with Jeff Skilling's office and he is not available on June 
26.  May we go back to the drawing board?  We can offer some time in the 
afternoon of August 7, 8 or 9 - possibly 2:00 p.m. on one of those days.  
Those dates are currently good for Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Dave Delainey.  
Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Sherri, I'm sorry I have been sending your e-mails to the "old" name.  I

Good morning, Jean - 

I understand from Rob Bradley that you are putting together some facts for 
Ken as he is moderator of this panel tomorrow in Austin.  He said that he 
would like some bullet points about basic trend data last five years re:  
natural gas production and oil production in the State.  He also would like 
facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the 
subject.

Thanks.

Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken 
had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have 
just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and 
the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would 
not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.

Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.

Hi Philippe -

Ken asked me to request that you call the above referenced gentleman.  He was 
referred by a friend of Ken's.  He wants to see if his oil on-line business 
is a fit for us.  Ken said he has no idea whether it will work or not, but 
please give him a courtesy call.

Steve Hellman at 212-628-7191 or cell phone 917-623-9730.

Thanks.

In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment and join the 
Ministerial dinner, with the Chair of the other Session in May, he said that 
he would be delighted to participate.

We look forward to receiving additional information after the Governing Board

Hi Corey -

My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought 
I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti 
Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for 
thinking I know anything about baseball.

Look forward to hearing from you!!

Love,

Aunt Rosie

On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken

Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
"Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =

These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
=20
customer migration. =20

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
=20
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
nt=20
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
ia=20
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
in=20
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
=20
of utility load.

Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
vehicle:=20
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
. =20
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
=20
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
ia=20
State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
ed=20
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
e=20
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
=20
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=
=20
=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=
ould=20
amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=
d. =20
In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=
=20
First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =
AB=20
1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=

Hi Liz -

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our "first" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

Take care and call if we can do anything.

Rosie

Dear Mr. Galvan,

Thank you for your recent letter concerning my support of a new basketball=

arena in Downtown Houston.  I believe that the responsibilities of my=20
position at one of the world=01,s leading companies extend far beyond day t=
o day=20
business- I take a leading role in the communities where my employees live=
=20
and work. =20

I agree that corporate stewardship is essential in our community. At Enron,=

we are aware of the underserved populations in our neighborhoods, which is=
=20
why each year we give back one percent of our earnings to charitable causes=
.=20
As we have grown, so have these donations. Enron=01,s community investments=
=20
include supporting programs that promote cultural diversity, educational=20
programming and scholarships, and assisting those struggling to rebuild the=
ir=20

Three years ago, Houstonians took the initiative to keep the Houston Astros=
=20
in town by passing a baseball stadium referendum that sparked the=20
revitalization of our downtown district. A new downtown basketball arena to=
=20
house our hometown Houston Rockets and Comets would amplify our current=20
efforts.=20

Houston has a vibrant, attractive, central business district that is=20

city. We must not allow our city to lose its competitive advantage on or of=
f=20
the court.=20

Enron has more than 6,500 employees who work and live in Houston and we all=
=20
take great pride in this city and its success.  We plan to stay in Houston=

for a long time, and it is essential that the Houston Rockets and Comets ma=

Sincerely,

Ken Lay

Letter dictated by Ken Lay

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

Ken

Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the 
appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire 
week of September 26.  

The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an 
afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Liz -

I had a very interesting conversation with Rocky.  He is still in business, 
just finishing up boots for the new President.    Also, I have been called 
"Precious" and "Baby" this morning.  Somehow, it just seems appropriate from 
him!!

He is located at RJ's Boot Company and Shoe Shop
3321 Ella Blvd. & 34th Street
Houston, Texas  77018

Can you provide me with the most recent Entex Deferral Balance?

Hey Lisa,

Long time no hear!  I guess you are too cool for all of us little people now.

Brenda is looking for someone to fill Bryan Hull's spot in risk when he 
leaves.  I know that you are looking for a rotation, so I was wondering if 
you have an interest.

Let me know.


Eric

Contrary to popular belief, the people that actually show up to the game do 
have other things they can do if they know that the other team members will 
not show up.  So, let me know whether or not you will be there.

Thanks for your help.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.


Thanks,

Eric

Rob,

I know we have visited before on this product, but now I would like to go 
ahead up.  I need to set up a Gas Daily Index product priced off of IF Katy.  
The short name would be IF GD/D Katy.

I got a Bed and Breakfast for Friday Night with one King Size Bed.  It will 
be nice and cozy for the six of us.

Just kidding - this is a pretty nice place - we have 2 dbls and the hotel is 
in between the stadium and 6th street.  (11th street).

the rate is $145.  the tickets are $30 - so - $54/person for everything.

we will leave at 4 on Friday if that is ok with everyone.

Unfortunately the Dream Matchup has been nixed by the Cotton Bowl.  UT is no 
longer in consideration for a Cotton Bowl berth.  It would have been fun to 
see how you fare against a top 5 team.

Maybe we will see you next year.  Of course, you will have to make it to the 
Rose Bowl.

Good luck in Dallas!

Dale,

The Texas Desk needs to get a new product created.  We already have a 
baseload Index Corpus product.  We need to create a DAY Corpus product with 
the same parameters as this baseload product.


Also, anything new on the 5 X 24?

Thanks,

Eric

Hey Michael,

I just wanted to confirm my position on the team.  I know you have already 
talked to Luis Mena about putting together a team, and I would like to be on 
that team.

Hopefully this year we can practice a little more and take home the 
championship.

Hook 'em.

I had a really fun time.  There were probably about 10 people from work there 
and my bro.  We stayed out until about 1:30 and then went home.

I'm going to start calling you "backout" if you don't shape up.

I was thinking that if we run trips on offense the other team won't know what 
hit them.  So I will draw up some plays.

Hi Mom,

Where are we staying in Telluride again?  I have been looking at some 
restaurants on telluride.org - it looks like they have some nice places.  
Maybe we should look into doing a sleigh ride or snowmobile dinner outing one 
night.

i will give you schroeder and raymont harris.

that is a fair offer considering your predicament at rb.

by the way engram was drafted in the eight round, so was harris, and 
schroeder was drafted in the 10th

that is an 8 and a 10 for 8

We are getting a group together to play paintaball tomorrow at around 10 am.  
We will be playing at Adventure Village (just north of Intercontinental 
Airport on FM 1960).  Their website is www.adventurevillage.com.  The total 
cost should be somewhere between $30-$40 per person ( about $15 for a gun and 
$6 per 100 paintballs).  Let me know if you can make it.

this any different from the other skin cancers that you get removed?

How are things otherwise?

I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the complaint 
form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the
form is the same that hired there ticketing help.

-E

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful 
except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for 
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride 
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the 
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because 
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for 
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of 
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no 
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which 
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was 
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline 
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us 
to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that 
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible 
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this 
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on 
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my 
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed 
our connection we were forced to spend a combined 
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, 
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead 
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten 
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of 
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again 
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:
Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna 
Husser, and Donnita Franklin.

Final Itinerary (after all changes) -
Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM
Flt. 6244 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PM

Flt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:00AM
Flt. 2273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah  1:15PM

Sincerely,

Eric Bass

Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power 
contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one 
year.  Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, 
counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and 
provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to 
closing.  My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power 
contracts.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Please forward this 
memo on to the lawyers on your team.

Dear Terry:

Thanks for your quick reply.  Wednesday at 2 PM works for me.  I would be 
happy to come to IBJ's offices.  I will be joined by two others on our team.  
I would propose to discuss the prospects and challenges for energy trading in 
Japan.  Let me know if this is OK with you.   Look foward to seeing you.

Regards,

Mark

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged

I spoke to Dr. Emilio Pinto, at the Sao Paulo lawfirm of Tozzini Freire about 
joining ISDA.  He and his firm are doing a lot of work for Enron.  He is 
familiar with ISDA and said he was interested in joining.  I told him he 
would get a call and some materials that he could present to his Executive 
Committee.  I reviewed with him the cost of $10,000.  Please give him a call 
at 011-551-1-2322100.  I think he could help build membership in ISDA in 
Brazil and eventually become a rep office for ISDA in South America.  He goes 
by Emilio.  I am working on a lawfirm in Argentina.  Let  me know if you have 
any questions.

Mark

Great conference in Amsterdam.  It was the best one yet.  I would like to 
have an IDSA sponsored energy conference in Houston sometime in the next 
year.  I think the time will be ripe to focus on (a)  energy derivatives 
around the world and (b) the application of web technology to energy.   If we 
do it right, we may draw a large group internationally and build our 
membership dramatically.  Let me know what you think.

Mark

I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I 
propose the following:

1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 
months

2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only 
the deal terms at the end of a call

The first change could be made immediately and the second change would 
require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the 
traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal 
terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.

I think the energy panel at the AGM on March 17, 2000 in Amsterdam should 
discuss (i) development of energy trading on the continent, (ii) energy 
documentation issues and (iii) regulatory barriers to energy trading.  This 
is a great time to do a panel on energy trading in Europe!  I will copy Paul 
and Justin in London to get their ideas on both topics and panel members.  
Perhaps we can have a conference call next week.

The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an 
injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would 
have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.  The stay allows EES to 
return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save 
the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC 
receivables.  In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a 
further review of the stay, at which point the litigation will return to the 
District Court for discovery and eventually trial.

Cynthia, Rick Grove and I talked by phone to Chairman Rainer today about 
energy.  I made the point that energy swaps should be treated just like 
financial commodity swaps.  Also, I pointed out that innovation has been 
slowed for electronic trading of energy by the current regulatory structure.  
I think it would be a good idea to prepare a "positive" letter from a few 
congressman encouraging a point of view on energy more like the Senate bill.

Brent, also who has the risk of Y2K under our contracts?  If energy is not 
delivered because of a Y2K problem, is that a force majeure event or 
otherwise excused?  Your are right to raise this issue.  Let me know what 
response you are getting.  Take care.  Mark

The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an 
injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would 
have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.  The stay allows EES to 
return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save 
the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC 
receivables.  In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a 
further review of the stay.  It is likely EES' service contract with USC will 
expire before any trial at the District Court.

The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over 
the past few years.  I think this environment requires additional time to be 
devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible 
service to our clients.  Within the next month, I have asked Janette to 
schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new 
organizational chart .  I  would envision that we would focus on the 
following:  

review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues
review of the top ten legal risks
form contracts and other documentation projects
legal budget
legal resources, inside and outside
performance metrics

In addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term 
longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC.  Let me 
know what you think about that.

Do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong 
opposition of the CFTC?  What kind of odds do you put on it?  It is a 
significant change if Treasury is not longer against us -- but it is a little 
hard for me to believe that it is real.  Should I try to make a trip to 
Washington in September?  Let me know.

Today, I talked to the GC of both Southern and Duke.  Each GC said they were 
not really up to speed on the issues.  I took the opportunity to walk them 
through the Nerc letter and the action taken at the Serc board meeting.  They 
each attempted to argue our fight was really with TVA.

That is a very interesting question.  I think we would eventually want to 
include derivatives in the cross default trigger because of their 
significance.  However, since we often have the far larger derivative 
position, it would seem at least now, this would more often work against us.

Please plan to attend a lunch this coming Friday in 30C2 with Sara and I and 
possibly some of the newer credit people to go through basic ISDA, CSA and 
confirmation issues.  We'll get started around Noon and probably go until 
1:30.

Cindy:
Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a 
challenge.  So far so good although I can't say that we are on any type of 
schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are 
using?  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces 
should I expect to be able to pump?  I'm trying to judge whether I should 
keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night 
owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy 
every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any 
suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?  Alos, do you have any secret 
methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?  Do you let her suck on a 
pacifier?  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at 
falling asleep on his own.

How's Jillian doing ?  I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be 
sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into 
tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bill's mother 
not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she 
took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care 
what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobile 
which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.



Sue,
How are you and Cate doing?  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit so 
that we can schedule a christening date?  Bill's older sister's husband Bill 
is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin 
something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.


Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and 
call or write me.

Love, Carol

Luanne:
Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC 
would be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating 
from S&P is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit 
Support Provider fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in 
Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the ISDA Schedule we would like to change the 
reference to "Goldman Group" to "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."

I will have Tana Jones draft an amendment and send it to you.  Call me if 
there are any problems with the above.

Tana,
Please draft an amendment for my review.

Jeff:
Just a few comments:

1. In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words "due to" 
need to be put after the word "means" in the first line.

2. In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae "as it relates to 
the Assigned Interest" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier comment 
on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment 
piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that 
happens to Pelican .  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese 
explain why.

3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the 
first sentence of such Section "the amount determined..." shouldn't it say 
"the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the 
Transaction".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Matters 
and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or 
Termination Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events 
occur.  What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each 
party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just 
determine it?

Fred:
Enclosed is a revised draft of the letter agreement.  Two points for you:

1. They want to roll over to next month the net payment that they will owe us 
for the month of March.  Are you okay with this?

2. They wanted to make it clear that their obligation to deliver barrells to 
us was only an amount equal to the amount that they own or control, even if 
that amount is less than the amount shown on the schedule or oin the Purchase 
Agreement.  In other words, they have no obligation to make up the 
difference.  Asr you okay ith this.  Alos, he told me to delete the "Amoco" 
language since  that lease was no longer part of the deal.

Let me know what you think.

Sorry I didn't call you last weekend.  How's everything at the office?  Is 
Julia back yet?  I wrote her a card and I hope that over the next few weeks 
and months she can grieve and at the same time get on with her life.  I 
really feel for her.  Keep me posted on how she's doing?  What have you and 
Ric been up to?  Charles and Arthur are doing great.  Bill's mom is here for 
a visit and we are having alot of fun.   I had lunch with Kristina last week 
and she updated me on the "Enron" happenings.  Seems like every week there is 
a major organizational announcement.  Where do you think Scott Sefton will 
end up?  She seemed to thing that he might take the compensation package that 
apparently was offerred to him.  It was good to talk to her and get back in 
touch with work.  I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it.  
Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so 
Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.  i 
still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start 
discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.  It's hard to believe 
that I have been out for over 3 months.  time really does fly by.  

Give my best to everyone and write back when you can.  Did Stacy have her 
baby yet?

Mark and Sara:
Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the 
other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also 
about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training 
and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her 
that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it 
made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's 
training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am 
very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process 
given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous.  
The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't 
tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's 
way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her 
that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's 
training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was 
more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.

On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to 
work better is through "communicating" to each other.  I firmly believe taht 
there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the 
other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit 
this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired 
of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my 
perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her 
increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude 
which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.

I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this 
to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.

Nedre:
Per your request, here is what we have decided:

1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned 
to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but 
until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to 
her.

2. We have passed on the following candidates:

Stephanie Panus
Patricia Slaughter
Donald Duhon
Debra Vincent


Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest  
to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie 
Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It 
would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over 
candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send 
their resume elsewhere.

Also, do you have references for Samantha? 

Please call me if you need any additional information.

Mr. Davis:
Susan Flynn passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft.  Please call me 
when you are ready to discuss.  With respect to the Guaranty amendment that 
we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section that 
if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for all 
of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were 
entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are 
incurred after the termination date.  I do not feel that the termination 
language, as currently written in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys clearly 
reflects this concept as the language as currently written states that the 
Guaranty "is revocable only with respect to liabilities occurring on or after 
the termination date."    I look forward to hearing from you.

Since late 1998, we have been trying to put in place a Master between ENA and 
the above counterparty.  We currently have a Master dated July 1997 between 
ECC and Pancanadian Petroleum Limited and Pancanadian wants to pretty much 
duplicate this Master.  Here are the credit terms of the late 1998 drfat that 
we sent them which I need for you to tell me are still okay:


No Credit Support Providers
Cross Default - $50,000,000 for ENA and $25,000,000 for them
Additional Event of Default - occurrence of a MAC and the failure to provide 
Perfprmance Assurance in accordnace with annex A.  MAC is defined as 
 Enron's rating going below BBB- and their Net Worth falling below 
$133,000,000 opr their Funded Debt to Net Worth being more than 1 to 1
They want to defined the "control" concept in Affiliate as ownership of more 
than 50% of equity.  This term is used in the Setoff language and limits the 
possible  entities that could be Affiliates on our side and their side
Forms of collateral are cash and LC's
Collateral Thresholds are $10,000,000 for us and $3,500,000 for them

Let me know what you think.

Brant
Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.


1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneok 
Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing 
Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are 
currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently 
guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a 
$10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.

2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its 
Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When 
all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all 
trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Master 
that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the 
Enron Guaranty be for?


Call me if you have any questions.

Susan,
Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this.  
Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master.

It's not clear to me what needs to be done on the file.  Has Paul contacted 
them about his note on 4/7?  If not, call Paul and find out if he wants you 
to make that call as that seems like the logical next step to take.  As far 
as their other comments, we cannot delete the Recording language on page 6 
and in the Confirmation language let's offer up 5 Business days.

We have finalized the amendment with Transcanada.  What we executed before 
still works.  We modified slightly the LC form.  They are faxing me their 
form of Guaranty and will send to Susan the docs.

Does anyone know why in our form of LC we have language that seems to qualify 
Section 13(b) of the UCP which sets forth the amount of time that the issuing 
bank has to honor drafts?  I don't see anywhere in our form where we modify 
this Section.  Here ios the current version that we are using.

Enclosed is a new draft of the Kennecott amendment letter.  Mark and I have 
discussed the counterparty termination language and have come up with the 
language that I have high;lighted.  Upon your approval, I plan to use the 
same language for the Duke and Cinnergy letters.

Enclosed is some sample surety bond language that we have used along with a 
surety bond form.  I have reviewed your form and think that we can use it 
with some minor modifications. The enclosed provisions will need to be 
modified to fit our situation and taht is part of what I want to discuss at 
our meeting next week so we can all understand how the bond gets issued, what 
it covers and how it gets triggered.   I look forward to seeing you next

Alicia
The only comment that I have to the swap schedules is that I think we need to 
have an exception built into the arbitration language that permits us to go 
to court to enforce the remedies that we describe in the confidentiality 
section.  This probably hold true for all of the docs where we have 
arbitration and a ca provision.  Alos, there may be some defined terms that 
are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined 
(i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)  Finally, should we upper case 
"affiliates" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def or 
some other def?

I received your voice mail.  Can someone fax to me at home a copy of the 
latest Talisman ETA amendment that Dave F. looked at?  Also, would it be 
possible to indicate on what you sent to me the parts that Dave F. didn't 
like?  It would make it easier for me to respond and less time consuming 
since I don't have much free time during the day but I'm happy to help out.  
As Mark knows, this was a highly negotiated series of amendments over a long 
period of time.  My hope is that we can work through Dave's concerns without 
having to retrade what we had agreed to on the legal side.  My fax number 
here is 281-890-8862.

Jeff Sorenson forarded me your letter to him regarding the Annex A letter 
that you received.  The reason that you received this letter was because of 
trades that we do with Aquila Canada Corp.  You are correct that we are in 
the process of finanlizing a Master with UtiliCorp but only trades with ARMC 
will go under that Master.  We are alos in the process of sending out a draft 
of the Master that we intend to put in place with Aquila Canada Corp but 
until that is completed, all trades with ACC will be done using the Annex A 
terms and conditions.  Please call me if you have any questions at 
713-853-3989.

Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it 
something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt 
the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's 
primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by 
possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that 
we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze

Thanks.  Per my voice mail messgae, are you okay with giving Cinergy the 
right to terminate?  This apparently is there only issue.  Also, how do you 
want to handle future requests for termination rights if we can't geta 
counterparty to back down from their request?  Do you want me to check with 
you each time?

Our credit person is okay with deleting the Independent Amount definition.  
Susan will make all the changes and coordinate with you in getting this

I'm slightly embarrassed to be asking you this, but there was one gift from 
Baby Gap that we can't seem to figure out who the "giver" was, and we've 
narrowed it down to a group that includes you.  It was 2 outfits with animal 
patterns on it.  Are you the mystery giver?

Alos, again I just wanted to say congratulations again on your engagement.  I 
am really happy for you and Trushar and wish you all the best.  I will try to 
see if we can get together for lunch before I leave.

I am working on the ETA amendment letter which I hope to send to you 
shortly.  We have a new procedure here where every amendment needs to be 
signed off by the head of the Online group so I need to get their blessing 
before I send it on to you.  Since most if not all of our issues were more 
legal in nature I don't foresee a problem with this.

Adele and Maria:
Here are my final comments:

1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day 
waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes 
effective?

2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.

3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like 
what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.

4. In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs 
to UCP.

That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the 
Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final 
versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your 
opinion shortly.

Jeff Hodge forwarded your voice mail to me.  I will give you a call later 
this morning to talk about the LC margin language that you need.  It might 
help me if you could describe how the margining will work.  Typically there 
is some dollar threshold against  which our Exposure is measured and anything 
over that threshold needs to be supported by collateral.  In addition, there 
is usually some Material Adverse Change trigger that reduces the threshold to 
zero.  Is that how yours will work?

Russell:
Here is a summary of the ownership chain of Global Companies LLC:

1. Its members are Global Petroleum Corp. ("GPC"), YPF Distribution Company 
("YPF") and Montello Oil Corporation ("Montello").  From what they sent to 
us, I could not tell the ownership percentages.

2. The affairs of Global are managed by a "Board of Governors" who are 
selected by the members.  Specifically, GPC and Montello collectively get to 
choose 3 board members and YPF gets to choose 3 board members.

I your credit worksheet, you had specified as a "MAC" trigger if YPF, SA 
fails to own at least 51% of Global Companies.  Is this the same entity as 
YPF Distribution Company?  Do you want this as a MAC or as an Additional 
Event of Default or Termination Event?

GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA:

1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the 
legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the 
second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf 
of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper 
exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the 
Website password?]

2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a 
similar indemnity.


I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1?

Here is where things stand on Engage:

1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of 
amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me 
their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the 
Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 

2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the 
Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the 
Engage Canada financial transactions.

I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will 
be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did 
send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files 
near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we 
resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm 
not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now 
with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted.

In an effort to better manage your work flows, Sara and I would like to meet

Thanks for the info.  I left a voice mail for Lou Stoler about the need to 
get outside counsel involved and he is going to look into that.  I will send 
you the CA shortly as it is in the process of being prepared.  I also spoke 
with Elizabeth Sager in the power group about assisting in the documentation 
of the derivative and she has agreed to help.  It may be a good idea to 
schedule a meeting with me, Elizabeth, Lou , you and others to walk through 
the derivative piece in more detail so that the power folks can ask you 
questions about it.  My assistant Suzanne Adams has my schedule (37340),  
Elizabeth's assistant is Brenda Whitehead (35438) and Lou's assistant is Dina 
Snow (57099).

Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all that 
much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all 
counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have 
asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding 
exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues 
to cover on Friday involve:

1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard 
langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to 
whether NY or Texas law applies.

2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties.  
For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a 
list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree 
with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.

3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.

I'm available anytime to talk about the above.

 Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have 
joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, 
Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day 
to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both 
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone 
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is 
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing?  
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing 
great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing 
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he 
has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting 
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's 
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are 
having fun.

Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he 
ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

Thanks for your e-mail.  With respect to one of your points, we have in the 
past agreed to modify Section 4(b) of the ETA by adding the following at the 
end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises from acts or 
omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or 
contrcators.''  Alos, with respect to the Deemed ISDA issue, for ENA or ECC 
trades, we do not consider the Deemed ISDA to constitute a "Master Agreement" 
and our deemed ISDA counterparties are required to accept the GTC's before 
trading.  Are the rules different in Australia?

Jeff:
Janice and I have been working on a deal with Fred LaGrasta that involves 
entering into a Crude Oil Purchase Agreement.  Their lawyer has come back 
with the following requests which Janice has asked me to run by you:

1. They want to delete the arbitration provision or at the very least delete 
the waiver of the right to recover attorneys fees.  They claim that this 
conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which 
allows for recovery of attorneys fees.

2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction 
clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit, 
execution, attachment or other legal process.

Can we give on these points?  They owe us back payments on financial swaps 
that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase 
Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what 
we owe them for the crude that we purchase.  It's a long story as to how we 
ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting 
them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if 
there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done, 
that would be great.

Here is what their letter should say to us:

Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 
from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. ("Guarantor") for the benefit of 
Enron North America Corp. ("Enron").  By letter addressed to you dated April 
6, 2000 (the "Termination Letter"), Guarantor terminated its obligations 
under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such 
Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty 
by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the 
Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 
to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 
6 to read as follows:  "This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date 
being the "Termination Date") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) 
the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as 
set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written 
notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such 
termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as 
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by 
Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such 
termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect 
to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the 
Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the 
terms of this Guaranty."

Please acknowledge your acceptance of the terms of this letter, by signing in 
the space provided below.

Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

Kevin

If you could only own one stock what would it be?  For me it would be EOG

Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin

Cherly,

I have been promoted out of the Associate program last PRC.  As a result, if 
you could take me off the Analyst/
Associate distribution list I'd deeply appreciate it.  Thanks and let me know 
if you have any questions or if you
haven't been notified of the promotion.

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Wow, what a gracious thank you.  I'm speechless.

Hope everything's been going well lately.  I'll talk to you soon.  By the way,
are you going to any events during Gas Fair?

one.  I heard
there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to

The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat 
troublesome
to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it 
as your primary car.

Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends 
I've had in ages.

Talk to you soon.

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just 
like Rena, huh?

As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller 
does though.
Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.

Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.  

Kevin

Anne Marie,

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to interview at UCLA on the 
11th.
Keep me in mind for next time though.

Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?  He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was wondering 
how
the citizens of California viewed him.  

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you 
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather 
spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  
The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire 
weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

Kevin

I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it.
How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the 
holidays or staying in LA?

Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin

What's the website you bought the Adirondack chairs off of.  We are looking
to pick up a couple more.

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Of course, after you assemble the chair.

Kelly,

I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 
firms and he
didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything 
changes, let me know.
It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.

I closed the Charles Schwab account that contained the Pedernales money 
becuase Schwab began charging a $15 per quater account fee. Does anyone have 
any suggestions about where to put it--other than in Doug Hester's college 
tuition. The account is up to(down to) $8500.

In theory, there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be 
admissable because of issues other than relevance--such as authenticity. It 
is hard to know the Evidence Rules of every jurisdiction. I would suggest the 
following language:

The parties to this Agreement agree that any such recording are admissable in 
any legal proceeding for any matters relevant to the Agreement, except for 
those recordings that violate the Parole Evidence Rule of the applicable 
jurisdiction.

I am Asst. Gen. Counsel---Litigation Manager at Enron North America. As the 
title implies I am in charge of all litigation in N. America . I also have 
responsibility for litigation in Europe. This job carries great 
responsibilities. Since I arrived in Jan of 1998, the stock has appreciated 
more than 100%. Need I say more. In this job I am also, on occasion,when the 
mood strikes her, allowed to ask irrelevant questions to Carrin Patman about 
how she is conducting our litigation. Suggestions are strictly off limits.   
I have several recollections--- Who can forget Richard Royd's 7am  breakfast 
meetings to answer associate questions. There was a meeting at 7 but there 
was no breakfast served and no questions answered. Sample question: "Richard, 
why does every firm other than Bracewell have free sodas" Response: "I'm glad 
you asked me that question but first let me tell you about the Bejing office" 
What about the Oscar Madison/ Felix Unger pairing of Bruce Feitchinger and 
Skip McBride.Skip should have known better----when he first interviewed 
Bruce,they  met at Kenneally's Irish Pub.    Personally,since I left the firm 
we have had another son,Matthew,age 11months. Julie has gone back to school 
to get her Montessori teaching certification to be able to teach at Post Oak 
School.

Two Questions for you Mike:




1) What relationship does Sen. Dunn have W/ Aguirre or Milberg Weiss---has 
hein the recent past, or is he now joint venturing cases with them?

2) Does the Lt. Gov have any ability by reason of his office to get access to 
the materials given to Sen. Dunn.

I am not sure about the purpose of this letter. The better response in my 
mind would be to have a process server arrive at their door. If we do send 
them a letter, and I leave that to you, we need to have already filed the 
petition. Then we can attach a file-stamped copy to the letter.

We wrote him a letter rejecting his offer of $250,000 and asked for $1 
million. It might be a good idea for you to call him and feel him out. We

The plaintiffs atty--Patricia Whatever has been against me in two cases. She 
sued GroupMac in one case and Enron in another. One day I'm sitting at the 
house on Tosca when the phone rings. Its her. She must have seen my name on a 
list of residents. She starts pumping me for info:Have you seen this dog on 
the loose in the area before. Now mind you when I was younger,slimmer and 
with less kids, I was in the yard all the time. I knew the stray dogs. I told 
her I had never seen their dog loose before and in fact I didn't know they 
had a dog. Needless to say I never heard from her again.

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to the 
issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch trial 
lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks

After further thought, it seems to me that in light of our fear of litigation 
w/ American Coal, we should keep the documents. To further insulate the Coal 
Group and you from any claim that Enron misused the information,I suggest 
that you transfer the information to me and I will hold it for safekeeping.

I think the list is unworkable because it requires us to do due diligence on 
all the attys on the list--a daunting task. The suggestion of outlining 
several firms is a good compromise.

Ecogas and its affiliates have claims and lawsuits outstanding against them 
totaling over $8.5 million. These cases are, for the most part , suits to 
collect on unpaid debts, for which there are very limited defenses. The 
likelihood of success on the defenses of these cases is small.

I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE 
insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.  This included around 23 hours by PB 
Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).  Does that sound 
right to you?  I have to allocate this to the business units - should it all 
go to East Power Trading?

The EnronOnline team has asked if we can discontinue sending copies of the 
GTC's when EnronOnline transactions are confirmed.  They have suggested a 
sentence be added to the confirmation to the effect that it is subject to the 
GTC's which can be accessed on the website.  Any thoughts?

Hi Debbie:

Thanks for your note - it's always nice to hear from MC friends!  

I'm living in Houston and working in the legal department of a large energy 
company (Enron).  I have two main areas of focus: derivatives trading (swaps, 
options, etc.) which I've been doing for over 6 years now and e-commerce 
which is relatively new.  The most fun work project I've had was being the 
lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading 
platform about a year ago.  It has been tremendously successful.  While few 
people have ever heard of it, it is the largest (by dollar volume) website in 
the world!

I keep in touch with Mark Kopinski who is managing a couple of international 
mutual funds in New York.  My work takes me there several times a year and I 
usually try to see him if I have some free time.  The college is thinking 
about another capital campaign and he and I were on a preliminary planning 
committee (to see if a campaign makes sense).  Ralph V. was there - whom I 
hadn't seen in years! - and of course I keep in touch with Doc, too.  I was 
on campus for my 20th reunion a couple of years ago.  There were only 2 of us 
from '78 so it wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped but it was still good to see 
familiar faculty faces.  With luck the 25th will draw a bigger crowd.

My Midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a 
terrible commute.  I hope you're liking your work to justify the drive.  I 
rarely make it back to Chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me 
know if you ever make it down this way.

Mark

Enron North America and Enron Europe will offer credit derivatives through=

For a number of reasons, including those identified below, Enron maintains =
a=20
=01&Restricted List=018 in connection with its credit derivatives business,=
 which=20
will list those entities that may not be included in the list of Reference=
=20
Entities or that have been deleted from the list of Reference Entities.  Th=
is=20
list is designed to comply with legal requirements, to deal with potential=
=20
conflicts of interest that might result because of our diverse activities,=
=20
and to prevent the appearance of impropriety in connection with Enron=01,s=
=20
credit derivatives trading activities.  The credit derivatives Restricted=
=20
List is designed for other purposes as well.  For example, a company may be=
=20
placed on the Restricted List if Enron is not able to assume any further=20
credit exposure to that company or believes that market conditions do not=
=20
warrant the trading of Credit Derivatives on such Reference Entity.

A company ordinarily will be placed on the credit derivatives Restricted=20
List, either before or after it has become a Reference Entity on which cred=
it=20
derivatives are traded, in the following circumstances:

when Enron is actively engaged in effecting a material transaction with=20
respect to such company that has not been publicly announced;

when Enron has an applicable standstill agreement or other confidentiality=
=20
agreement in place with such company;

when Enron has a legal duty to keep such company's information confidential=
=20
and such company has not expressly consented to being a Reference Entity fo=
r=20
purposes of the trading of credit derivatives (such a legal duty may be a=
=20
fiduciary duty but may not rise to that level);

when some part of Enron acquires material, nonpublic information about a=20
company or its securities in the course of its business activities;

when Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with respect to such=
=20
company.

The purpose of this memorandum is to alert you to this new business and to=

request your assistance in evaluating proposed Reference Entities prior to=

the trading of credit derivatives based on such companies.  Below is a list=

of proposed Reference Entities.  Please take a few minutes to look at this=

Here is the North American legal issues list I prepared for Mark.  He 
actually called me down to ask for it yesterday (my first day back no less).  
Obviously I've kept it to just the major areas where there might be residual 
legal risk.  He seemed satisfied enough with the format.  I explained that I 
had mentioned his request to you and that you were working on a European 
version which might turn out to be somewhat longer since you have so many 
jurisdictions to deal with.

I spoke with Susan Bulgawicz again today.  She relates the following points:

Gensler has been subcontracted to do interior space planning and design for 
the new building generally
While our work is probably in addition to that already agreed (and will 
therefore be billed to us) it should be covered by an amendment to the 
existing agreement rather than a new, separate agreement
Bill Donovan feels that the design and space planning work should be done as 
near in time as possible to the actual construction work to avoid having to 
redo the work (and pay twice) to take into account new factors not apparent 
earlier (e.g. organizational and technology changes)
Bill's view is that we are 3 to 6 months premature at this point in doing 
this work for the legal department

Susan suggested that you might want to call Bill to discuss this and talk 
about how you want to move forward.

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone 
thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we 
want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, 
etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities 
within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.

Let me know what you think.

Julia sent me a copy of your memo following up on one of the questions asked 
at the session earlier this week.  I would like to ask a follow-up question:

Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code 
when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) 
netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a 
counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements 
(swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to 
determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a 
single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since 
arguably we are no longer just "under a swap agreement?"

I have read about the Super Maramu 2000 and note from your website that you 
have a location on the Mediterranean in France.  I will be in Southern France 
September 23 through 25.  Would it be possible to visit you in Hyeres during 
that time?  Is an appointment necessary?

Ohmygawd!  An e-mail message from Hal!  Now I know we really ARE in the 21st 
century.

I also get to Key West on the 24th and will be there until the 28th and don't 
need a place to stay because I will be at the conference hotel.  Ted will get 
there Friday eve.  I have meetings during the days Thursday & Friday and Sat. 
morning; dinner on Friday is also a scheduled event for me.  Otherwise I 
don't think we have specific plans.  Looking forward to it!

I won't be able to attend the forum since I am travelling but do have a 
suggestion that would make TAP a bit more attractive.  When a traveller is 
placed on a "wait list" the agency should check back with the provider 
regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared.  If you wait for the 
provider to get back to you, as appears to be TAP's policy, the chances are 
significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the 
person on the phone before anyone on the list.  Other agents have done this 
for me, I have done this for myself, and it works.

Paul - 

Thanks for your voice mail.  We can't print the list of Reference Entities 
from the website because we have not been given access.  We do need to get 
that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the 
list that Michael referred to.  

The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final 
list of Reference Entities for their launch.  That list absolutely must be 
scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.

Today's simulation has been postponed to next Wednesday.  Unfortunately, they 
have not yet opened the system to the entire web - you have to be on the 
Enron intranet to get access.  If you want to see it badly enough, I might be 
able to arrange something for you in our NY office (midtown) otherwise I'll 
let you know when they roll it out onto the web.

Hey Jim,

Thanks for the note.  Nothing much new to report here.  Ted was in South 
Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.  He's still trying to 
talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out 
what I really want.  I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and 
will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the 
continent that's warm.  Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's 
and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.

Let us know when you find a place to live

Mark

I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the "green book" and 
my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an 
Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far 
enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number 
when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the 
Independent Amount).  The theory there is that as the market moves against 
us, we are cushioned by our "out-of-the-moneyness" and will be able to ask 
for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in 
the money.  I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption 
that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.  We 
need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the 
credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be 
given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the 
paralegals can suggest something?).  I suggest we add the following language 
(taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells 
us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far 
we go out of the money:

 "Credit Support Amount" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as 
provided in the definition of that
  term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
Amounts.

I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would 
like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of 
alternatives for Paragraph 13.

Hi Marc!

Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat. night for "Holiday Cheer" which at 
our house means cocktails by the Christmas tree and maybe some of my 
wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog.  We'd love to see you guys.  
It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go 
to, you could make this one the kick-off.

The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of 
champagne we're going to share at home that night.  I asked T if we should 
plan anything and got the "quiet night at home" reply.  That, of course, will 
change to "Why didn't you plan anything?!" around 12/29 or 30.

How's BMC?  What are you doing for them?  Do you know Clayton Williams?  I 
think he still works there.

Give us a call so we can catch up.  Tell G we said hi & hope to see you 
Saturday!

Just on the off chance you haven't had enough regarding EnronOnline to think 
about recently, Louise has announced meetings on Thursday and Friday of this 
week to discuss "Phase II" of the project.  It seems like an opportune time 
to come up with our wish-list of possible changes to the site and the legal 
structure.

Would it work if we picked you up in the USVI?  I know it's possible to fly 
into St. Thomas either directly from New York or through San Juan and you 
could take a ferry to St. John (still part o the USVI) where we could pick 
you up.  It's a bit of a hassle since we have to clear the boat into the US 
and then back to the BVI but I've done it a couple of times before.  The 
timing might be difficult since we can't possibly get the boat to St. John 
before the afternoon of the 22nd.  If you're nervous about sailing into the 
BVI, we could stick around St. John for a few days.  You might check the 
cruising guide & see what it says about the US side of things - places to 
go/anchor, etc.

If you didn't believe us before, I'm sure it is by now painfully clear that 
negotiating master swap agreements is a very lengthy process.  My impression 
is that the commercial team in Portland is anxious to begin trading 
financially.  If this is correct, it would be possible, at least from a legal 
point of view, to begin trading now under the existing documents.  In each 
case where a master agreement is already in place, trades entered into before 
the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties.  Our only 
issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive 
credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is 
signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage.  As to the credit 
issue, only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading 
under the existing terms.  As for the negotiating leverage, if the commercial 
people want to resume trading immediately, my suggestion would be to let them 
go ahead.  If it turns out that additional leverage is needed, we can always 
stop trading.

Where no master swap agreement exists, we have documentation available to 
enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed.  The so-called 
"omnibus" confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative 
transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions - 
even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty.

Tana has unsuccessfully tried to get you access to our Lotus Notes database 
so you could determine the status of any negotiation on an up-to-the-minute 
basis.  She will be sending a monthly report of our progress until you get 
the necessary software to access the database.  Of course, if any issues come 
up in the meantime, please continue to feel free to call.

We should probably start thinking about an agenda for this meeting if only so 
that we can determine appropriate attendees and get it on their calendars.  
Do you have anything in particular in mind?  Were you thinking 
legal/regulatory/operations/business/marketing?

Do you remember negotiating any master agreements for ECT that did not 
contain the necessary elements for trading energy commodity derivatives?  In 
particular I'm thinking about things like the trade opiton exemption 
representations and the commodity derivatives definitions provisions.

Tana and I were unable to find anything useful here.  David Mitchell thought 
he might find something for us in his files and will send it to us but as he 
remembers it, we never got very far with the details.  He probably just 
advised that if we ever did set up a CTA that it should be completely 
separate - both in legal entity and staff - from our trading activities and 
should be Chinese Wall fenced  as well.  I'll send over whatever we receive 
from him and warned him that you might be calling.

Thanks for your note - I am actually checking my e-mail with my laptop at the 
airport in Minneapolis.  I was in DC on Wednesday (too bad Tim & Sharon 
aren't back) and then flew on to Monmouth (well, flew most of the way - the 
closest airport is still a bit over an hour drive away) for a capital 
campaign planning committee meeting.  Mark Kopinski was there and he and I 
had dinner with Dr. Kieft (our fraternity advisor and one of my chem. 
professors) who is still teaching.  I'm now on my way back to Houston - 
flight delayed but shouldn't be getting back too late.  Hope you are well.

Love,

Any progress on the EnronOnline front?  I'm getting questions from the EOL 
team in Houston as to our time estimate to completion and wondered if you had 
heard back from outside counsel.

Pets In the Office
 It's A Growing Trend

 In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some 
companies. Workers are bringing their
 pets to the office. 

 Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has 
been taking his golden retriever,
 Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early 
Show and talked with Co-Anchor
 Jane Clayson. 

 The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. "He brings a lot of 
emotion and people love it. He's
 very relaxed." 

 But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to 
the office if he wishes. Not
 everybody can bring their pet to work. 

 "A lot of it depends on the dog," says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not 
a rowdy dog. 

 "He just hangs out," explains Paucek. "He's easy to get along with." 

 Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, "My wife 
brings him in and drops him off at
 the office," Paucek says. 

 While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also 
many legal issues to consider. John
 Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend 
of bringing pets to the work
 place is really growing. 

 "More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their 
working place
 employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace," 
says Challenger 

 He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and 
employees need to explore before
 they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy. 

 "One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a 
policy like that, is take a poll
 of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain 
employees that don't feel
 comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy." 

 There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be 
liable if a dog or cat bites or
 scratches another employee. 

 "The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of 
policy in effect," says
 Challenger. "The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites 
someone or the cat scratches
 someone, it can't be the company's fault." 

 Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office. 

 "Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, 
will you put them in a
 certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? 
Many don't feel
 comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats 
and dogs and what
 about birds? What about the noise of birds?" 

 Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, "It gets 
chaotic." 

 In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners. 
They found that: 

      21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 
      76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the 
job 
      33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals


 If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should: 

      poll employees before they let the pets come 
      provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome 
in the office 
      establish an off-limits-to-pets area 
      make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated 
      bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office 
      tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times


 If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should 
make a rotating schedule. 

 When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great. Paucek says when 
he and Hoss arrive at work, "I get
 off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the 
employees. He has his own
 web page."

Paul:

Here is the FSA letter with my comments inserted in red.  I have tried to 
make it a bit stronger by deleting references to our positions being merely 
"arguable."  The language I deleted in the first part of 3.4 I thought was 
unnecessary and just point out doors that may remain open for the SFA.  The 
language added in 3.5 was an attempt to show how much EEFT does vs. 
EnronOnline.

Is there a reason we are referring to Net Works rather than EnronOnline LLC?  
It is also a Delaware limited liability company.  Are we afraid it may have a 

I also wonder if the discussion of EPOL's involvement in 2.2 and 4.2 is 
really needed since the ETA is entered into on EEFT's behalf.  If this has 
not yet been raised by the SFA, it doesn't seem necessary to flag it for 
them.  My position would be that EEFT is a party to that agreement whenever 
it is necessary in connection with an investment.

Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online 
system.  I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most 
recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that 
I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date.  They do have the advantage of 
being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today.  I don't 
think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as 
starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest 
material.

The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective 
counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper.  The first time the 
counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required 
to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an "I 
Agree" box after scrolling through the agreement.  The GTC's are the 
contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master 
agreement in place.  Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty 
to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary.  While 
most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our 
"Omnibus" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a "Deemed 
ISDA."  One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two 
sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have 
no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is 
not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call 
for collateral if we choose.

Since the recent pet coke swap (deal 8025) is really a US deal, we should

Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the 
Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting
Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System 
Coordinating Council are ``poised on the
precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer 
and next, according to a new study of the regional
market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West 
stands at least a one in three chance of
experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during 
the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior
Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.

ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications: 

     Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand 
balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying
     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak 
capacity requirements. Because demand growth is
     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more 
extreme over the next two years.
     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive 
year of above-average hydroelectric generation
     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again 
mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in
     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, 
the West will find itself at an even greater risk of
     price spikes.
     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 
2000, the result of both higher regional spot
     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the 
value of ensuring reliability for consumers. 

The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and 
highlights the following key results: 

     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand 
growth is strong, creating a long-term regional
     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a 
serious economic downturn in the region.
     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices 
is for negative real growth through 2010, but
     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market 
institutions continue to evolve and new supply is
     slowly added over the next few years.
     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue 
to rise (but still remain below many other
     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.
     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power 
generation is poised to more than double by 2010,
     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest 
subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas
     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if 
any, real price appreciation through 2010. 

``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the 
other five regional volumes, offers
comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power 
markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the
ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic 
capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the
fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from 
working one- on-one with the market's key
players.''

About the ICF 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

ICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, 
an authoritative assessment of North American
regional bulk power markets through 2010. The study also provides the 
analytical basis for ICF's extensive and well-respected
consulting services providing market assessment, asset valuation, and project 
due diligence evaluations for the North American
electric power and natural gas industries. The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is 
available for six regional markets -- West,
Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, and Canada -- well as a 
National Subscription, which includes the six regional
studies and a North American summary volume. Additional information on the 
1999 Bulk Power Outlook, including a
prospectus, sample volume, and order form, can be found at

The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is part of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group's 
growing family of products and services. Related
studies on energy and environmental issues recently completed by ICF include 
the SO2 Allowance Market Outlook and the
Ozone Transport Region: NOx Allowance Study, which detail ICF's views on air 
emissions allowance markets.

Bill,

Thanks for the info.

Just so you know, The Moorings provides airport transfers so there will be 
somebody with a "Moorings" sign waiting right after you get through customs 
who will get you into a van or bus to the base.  It's a little harder to get 
to Tortola from Houston so I leave at 6:10 in the morning but don't get there 
until a few hours after you guys (on AA5684 which gets there at 5:21).

 It turns out I also need everyone's birthday and address.  Mind sending 
yours along?

Mark

Edmund - 

I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives 
(I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have 
attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).  Basically I 
don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is 
already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only 
creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.  My 
other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is 
that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't 
think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can 
discuss my concerns?

No trouble in N.O.  I was there for a conference with all 300 Enron lawyers & 
paralegals from all around the world - it didn't seem prudent to go looking 
for trouble with all those Company folks wandering around the Quarter!  I 
just came on home Friday evening & went to bed.

T. said you looked like you were having fun Friday night but didn't stay out 
late enough to find out how much fun.....

As you know, I will be out of the office next week.  I will have the cell 
phone with me:

   011 44 7881 512 535

but unfortunately no way to recharge the thing after Sunday morning and no 
guarantee that it works in the Virgin Islands anyway.  I suggest that if you 
try that number and do not get an answer that you NOT leave a message there.  
It will be much more likely to get to me if you leave it here at the office 
(x37459).

There will be a cell phone on the boat, however, and I will call Taffy  
(x57373) Monday morning with the number.

'Twas The Night Before Christmas
as written by a lawyer

'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual 
Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity 
was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the 
first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus 
musculus.  Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the 
wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure 
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose 
folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the 
second part).

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective 
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual 
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through 
their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head 
coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness 
when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such 
a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from 
my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this 
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected 
as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be 
said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my 
incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered 
conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,  
piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it 
became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. 
With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more 
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly, 
expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of 
the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et 
al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through 
which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 
32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 
180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity 
and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad 
entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of 
carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His 
resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of 
assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary 
dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The 
capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with 
blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the 
coloration of Albion's floral emblem,  the latter that of the Prunus avium, 
or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much 
as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared 
like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, 
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative 
seasonal circlet of holly.  His visage was wider than it was high, and when 
he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the 
manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in 
short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the 
optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every 
effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one 
eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that 
trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, 
he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the 
aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned 
previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this 
task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in 
lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in 
a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating 
(in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector 
onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his 
contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded 
to soar aloft in a movement  hitherto observable chiefly among the 
seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting 
exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits 
of visibility:

"Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency,
and to that self same assemblage,
my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly 
pleasurable period between sunset and dawn."

Just a thought:  I'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized 
credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line - but if 
there are master agreements in place, the  credit provisions contained in 
them would apply to on-line trades.  The availability of the on-line system 
may therefore encourage more master agreements since the Credit Dept. will 
limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed.

I wish I could take credit for the link success but none of the things I was 
trying were what actually did it.  Seems that if you copy from Netscape and 
paste into this e-mail system it happens automatically.

Now this one is actually the result of extra geek effort on my part: BVI 
Weather.

I'm leaving for a conference here in Houston now and may not be back in the 
office before leaving for NY.  I'll have my computer with me but am notorious 
for being incapable of accessing my e-mail on the road so telephone is 
probably the safest way to reach me from here on.  I check messages at the 
office fairly often.

(281)367-1100 (Woodlands Resort & Conference Center - tonight)

We're thinking about flying down to some nice sunny spot and renting 
("chartering" is the technical term) a boat for a week.  We've done this 
quite a few times in previous years: British Virgin Islands, Martinique, St. 
Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Grenada, etc.

I decided I needed the book we discussed so I went online to Amazon.com
 and ordered it!  While there I found references to a number of books I 
tought you might be interested in:

the Hornblower series by C.S. Forester
the Bolitho stories from Alexander Kent
the Drinkwater series from Richard Woodman (e.g., "An Eye of the Fleet")
the Ramage series from Dudley Pope
Revolution at Sea Trilogy/James L. Nelson
Lobscouse & Spotted Dog : Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the
                     Aubrey/Maturin Novels

Justin - 

David Samuels and Rahil Jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to 
get people to use EnronOnline.  They want to set up a sports fantasy league 
system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding 
prizes to the winners.  The first proposal relates to European football (I 
think) and they would like to meet to discuss the idea at 10:00 a.m. Houston 
time Tuesday.  Any chance you might be available to listen in?

Hey Mark - I thought you had my new (as of July 1997) address - sorry about 
that.  I'm now at:

1322 Rutland
Houston, TX 77008

(713)863-7190 - home
(713)853-7459 - work

I heard about Mrs. Boone in the Scots News.  I thought it was a nice 
write-up.  The Boones were very special people and I regret extremely that I 
didn't get to know them better.

Hope you guys are doing well.  I was in NYC in Nov. but was so busy I didn't 
have time for visits or fun of any kind!  Hope to get back soon but there's 
nothing for NY on the calendar.  Probably DC early Jan., London late Jan. and 
Buenos Aires and Sao Paolo in Feb.  I saw the magazine article (with such 
good photos!) a couple of months back.  My mom actually called to tell me 
about it.

Did you guys get my Christmas card?  I thought Celena might get a kick out of 
it.  Tell Debbie & Celena I said "Hi!" 

Take care,  Mark T.

For your information. please find attached the spreadsheet that I sent to 
Calpine for their consideration. 

Action: 

Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper 
legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.  At this time, Peter and I 
are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will 
discuss on Monday.

Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again. The real 
producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our 
numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front 
end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal. 


Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves 
for a package out to the producers for early next week. 

Stephanie.. one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals... 
overview... do we have anything available.  

Talk to everyone on Monday.

I hope this is the first e-mail you open on Monday when you get it. !!!

1. The closing date on my house is Nov. 30  ----- Are we ready for it?
2. I need a power of attorney as I will not be in Houston to transition.  I 
will be in on the 2nd of Dec.
3.  I do not have a US bank accounts as of yet and am trying to get these set 
up now.. but I need to know how to get the money to you.
4.  Do you have all the final economics on costs, mortage amount, Taxes, Int. 
Rate, Monthly payments.
5. You sent me a package which lists all of the closing costs.. Am I too 
assume you are paying those directly and getting reimbursed by ENA or do I 
need to pay them myself?
6. Have you secured mortage financing for me ? 

MONDAY morning is very important for you and I go hammer out final details.

Mark, Stephanie further to our conversations please find a summary list which 
I will need some help on.  As part of our business plan for 2001 Phillip and 
myself will make a presentation to Delainey et al regarding the West 
Initiatives.  This is going to happen by Dec. 8.  

As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.

Producer Services 
Transportation
Origination/ Middle Marketing
Trading


Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that 
outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can 
incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new 
group. 
 
The key subject items should include:  

SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. 
SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will 
we implement ?)
SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area
SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?)
BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc. 


If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go 
through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives. 

Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.  

BT 

Thanks,  BT

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

Bridge Loan.  She needs a letter on file verifying that I will have these 
funds. 

We still need to decide where we are going to put this money. For right now, 
we should plan on me signing the promisary note by fax, and then have a 
cheque sent up to me in Canada so that I can consolidate with the rest of the 
funds required for closing.

Hi Dede

Got your message - I would have loved to go; instead I was stuck on a 
roller-coaster of an airplane for over 5 hours fighting a "terrific headwind" 
according to the pilot.

See you at 11:00 unless I hear from you.

Enclosed are those documents I believe would be impacted if we elect to use 
separate Credit Support Annexes, one for the new EPMI ISDA and one for the 
Power Master (already in existence ("Old CSA")).  

 1. New Credit Support Annex - to be attached to EPMI/ML ISDA ("New CSA").  
Draft enclosed, including one marked to show changes from CSA currently in 
place between ENA and ML.

 2. Schedule to ISDA - Part 4(F) would reflect New CSA rather than Old CSA.  
Revised Schedule attached.

 3. No Amendment to Power Agreement would be required.  (Delete document 
named "Power Amendment 1).

Hi Susan

How's things going?  I hope at least OK if not well.

Delete my rambling voice mail if you haven't heard it .

Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.  We would, of course, love to come to 
your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own 
birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well 
(wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without 
having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after 
all it is your party - mine's next).  Let me know what you think.

FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction 
that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help 
in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 
853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.   
Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing 
to all parties.

Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE 
NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash 
collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.

Thanks again.

Hi Andy
I received this email but for some reason I can't open it.  Today is my last 
day in the office until the 22nd.  Can you resend this to me and I will look 
at it when I get back next week.  If it can't wait that long, go ahead and 
send to David Portz and he may be able to assist you.
Look forward to talking to you soon.

Hi Andy

I will speak on any panel, but my preference would be the  1st panel and I 
would speak on the CA experience and how EEI helps.  Also, I'd be happy to do 
products on day 2.  Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you soon.

PS Thanks so much for the plant - it is resting comfortably in my office and 
reminds me of all the times at EEI meetings and the wonderful friends I have 
met during this process.

Just to be sure we are working with the "latest form" of Enron guaranty, 
could you get from Tana the most current swap one and the check it agaianst 
the one we use for EEI - I would think they should be the same;  if not, lets

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION
NOT DISCOVERABLE

Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.  PCA 
claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's 
wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.  This amount appears to be 
based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, 
and certain "preference payments" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.  This 
claim is in its preliminary stages.  I will update you with further 
information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really 
seeking.  As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending 
against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable 
amount.

Bill

In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have 
someone gather the following information:

1.  Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net 
amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April 
deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we 
received from PCA would have been around May 20th).

2.  Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for.

3.  The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated 
transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had 
calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939)

As always, thanks for your help.

I'm not sure - I kind of think we need to keep going to some of these 
meetings, if nothing else to educate the industry and to listen to the 
western crowd.  With limited resources we will need to figure out which ones 
but ...  Talk to you later

I haven't stopped crying since I got your email .. Of course I've been crying 
everyday, several hours a day for months now, so it is hard to tell whose to 
blame .... You are welcome as always to come by anytime to watch the tears 
(maybe you will happen upon another fine hour like when I accidentally killed 
our goldfish on Sunday) or to pick up the ladder.

Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an "Into Product" is 
and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission 
and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.  Attendees from 
Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last 
name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.  If you think somebody 
else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I 
can talk to Harlan.  Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an 
internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet 
with Dynegy.

As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively 
with a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product 
is.  Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against 
they way the product ultimately got defined.  Dynegy put on a big dog and 
pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that 
EEI's Into product was flawed.   Their position, while not completely 
expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are 
making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be 
excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in 
general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another 
interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when 
firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the 
receiving control area).  Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they 
have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go 
physical.  At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in 
firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent 
product.  Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.

I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:

1.  Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition 
- Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.  We 
trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common 
understanding of what we are trading.  Critical to clear up this ambiguity.

2. Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against 
EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost 
acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice 
against the Into definition.

3. Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what 
will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is 
such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally 
we all agree how it should operate. Additionally, it is critical that we 
start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in 
transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may 
want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes 
into an RTO)

Call me with any questions/thoughts.

Thanks
Elizabeth

Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas 
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the 
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the 
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less 
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) 
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya

I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the 
armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport 
only to be intimidated by the words "no less than a 4 hour wait"   (on hard 
floors) .

Any advice?  Your experience certainly must have been better.

I'll send you the attendees list when I get it from EEI - meetings in the 
West frequently do have many "commercial" folks as well as lawyers and credit

Attached is a preliminary draft of the Legal Risk Chart.  You will need to 
open this in "Read Only mode"

Richard and Jeff - 

As we discussed,  I will need further assistance from you to complete several 
of the entries.  I have put your names by the entries that will either need 
to be updated or to be completed. I believe Julia and Mark T would be the 
best to provide updated information on the SEC Risk and the CFTC Risk , 
respectively, and I will get with them shortly to update.  This document has 
limited access; only my assistant, Brenda Whitehead can view/revise.  
Accordingly, Jeff and Richard - please either call me to discuss your 
comments and I can complete the chart with Brenda or else provide Brenda with 
your written comments.  Thanks for your help.

Hi Tim

Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still 
have relating to PCA.  

PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed  
a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected 
receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had 
with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract 
provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) 
and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still 
a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the 
current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any 
additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the 
bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to 
other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other 
creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment 
that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).

Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell 
her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the 
unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such 
amounts received from PCA back to you. 

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks
Elizabeth

Peter

Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying 
off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly 
decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe 
harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know.

Hope all is well.

Hi John

Today has disappeared so I don't think we will be able to squeeze in a

the Denver office if need be.  Thanks again and I look forward to speaking

Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs 
next week.

On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this 
schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the 
first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule?

EPMI/Comed capacity deal was never filed (EPMI has no current requirement to 
file). The owner of the facility never filed anything on the assumption that 
there was an oral, short term arrangement.  FERC requires approval for

I have scheduled a meeting for October 7th from 8:30 to 2:30 in room 3321 to 
recommence the project we began in January to review the existing 
Houston-based financial, gas and power trading forms.  All of you should have 
received a black binder labelled "Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas 
Forms"  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as 
such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to 
how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, 
assignement, confidentiality ....).  If you did not receive or cannot locate 
this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.  This 
analysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have 
changed since then but have not undertaken to "update" the memo as we will be 
able to discuss such changes at the meeting.

The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based 
trading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences.  
The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's "model" trading provisions 
should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified 
rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.  With this in 
mind, I would hope to be able to create a "modular type" contract  whereby 
each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language 
that will be approved by the group.  By way of example, Enron's gas contract 
prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any 
reason.  The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably 
withhold its consent.  At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred 
approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, 
which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.  This  "modular 
assignment section" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless 
differences were required due to the commodity/product involved.

You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas 
of a trading contract.  Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with 
other provisions such as credit terms.  At the meeting, I hope to further 
discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.

Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer  from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to 
assist us in this effort.

Thanks

Hi Cregg

Got your email - I don't know of any openings now but will certainly keep my 
eyes and ears open, and if I hear of anything I will let you know.  Good luck 
to you in your search - with your self realizations in tow (cynicism is 
always appreciated and confidence is a boon) , I'm sure an even better 
opportunity will present itself.

I think I could 3:30 (deal may be closing, but unlikely - if it did I might 
have to cancel - I would know by lunch). If you want, we could maybe try 
hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try 
there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is 
terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.  If this doesn't work, just 
let me know and we can find another time.

Confidential; Attorney client work product; Not discoverable

Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, 
I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if 
we get any "cap" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't 
accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover 
entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the 
past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may 
not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him 
tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the 
termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case 
our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what 
you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks

Sounds great - I was at the Met last night doing drills and reserved a court 
for 1130 - also, wasn't sure it this would work, but Dede and I have talked 
about having one of the pro's in training (Micky) drill us and I spoke with 
him and I think he would be available.  Would you'all like to do that?  Let 
me know.  See you at 1130.

Harrison called this am at home.  He said that you'all had discussed plans 
for Sat.  Because it's his B-day he wants to go out  - He seemed to suggest 
that you were on board, so I said OK too.  Hope that's OK.  There may be a 
basketball game and dinner in the offing.  Talk to you soon.

Kristin,

Per Greg Whalley, we need to install the Executive Report Viewer on Dave 
Delainey's computer.  He should have access to everything that Whalley has.  
Approval, for now, will remain with Whalley.  Greg would like this taken care 
of ASAP.

call liz and get on my calendar.  maybe we can grab lunch or something.  i 
heard about the ag meeting.  sounds like things could have gone better, but 
it also sounds like jeff was a little difficult.  he never has liked the 
notion of that business though.  i'll try to explain it next week.

Jim,

Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from 
Kathyn Corbally.  The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with 
1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.  The slides shows a 5% percent increase 
and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.

Please advise.

Liz

i assumed it was intentional, but wanted to make sure.  for the moment it 
works, but if our volumes continue to rise, we need to move to absolute

I'm asking you to personally all each of them today, and encourage them to 
make their pledge.  If any names listed below are not with your department, 
please notify Liz @ 31935.  Should they have problems getting online, please 
give Liz a call.

Thank You,

Greg

the thing that i will also tell you is that both flight options and travelair 
will allow you to arrange a demo flight and will only charge you the hourly 
rate as if you were an owner.  since you are not paying monthly fees or 
capital, this is a really good deal.  i would suggest doing this with both of 
them before you decide to buy anything  --  ideally on a long flight with a 
big plane.

i want to make sure that the current bid of $12,115 for a round trip to turks 
and caicos is correct.  i would also like to find out what landing fees, 
international taxes and/or overnight hanger fees i will have to pay if i book 
this trip.  the note at the bottom of the "view trips" page also says that 
bids are subject to availability.  will availability be confirmed at the time 
i book the trip?  or will i have to wait some period of time to find out?

George,

My Assistant, Liz Taylor, is the United Way Coordinator for Enron Net Works.  
Your group is listed with Net Works' United Way campaign.  Our participation 
numbers are very low.  We started yesterday with our telephone and personal 
visit campaign.

Liz has listed below the employees, she believes, belong to your 
organization.  These are the names of those employees who have not gone 
online to make their pledge.  Please have your Assistant verify this list.  
If they are indeed your employees, I'm asking you to personally call them and 
ask them to go online and make their pledge.  If any of the names listed

Mr. Piazze,

I'm Liz Taylor, Greg Whalley's Admin. Assistant.  We have spoken a few times 
in the past.  I have just a few questions concerning the event on December 13:


When in the evening will Greg give his speech?
Who long is he scheduled to speak?
Are you wanting him to have a slide presentation or just talk?  He promises 
to be entertaining (smile).  He really is a greater speaker, if I may say so.
What is the dress code?


Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

just saw that Louis Dreyfus traded with us today.  good job!!

one concern though -- several of the new names that we see coming across show 
up for 1 trade and then don't come back.
are we getting any feedback from them on the WTI product??  it can't just be 
the size.

we currently have nothing working with redmeteor.   i have spoken with 
dicosmo a couple of times, but he has never seemed interested in persuing 
anything.  we would be willing to discuss an arrangement where enron posts 
some of its prices directly from EOL to redmeteor, but i question whether his 
technology is up to it.  we are entering into arrangements like this with 
other trading platforms.  there is certainly no reason to avoid talking to 
them, but i would suggest a conversation with Andy Zipper on the EOL team.  
he is the one that is handling these types of deals.  i will also forward 
your message to him.

thanks for the heads up

Mr. Sutton,

I'm emailing you on Greg Whalley's behalf.  Is it possible for Greg to join 
you on the company plane on Sunday over to London for the Open House?    I 
understand you have different plans on the return.   I can book him 
commercial on the return.  No worries, if the answer is no, I'm holding 
commercial flights both ways.

   Sunday, February 27
   Depart Houston @ 8:00a.m.
   Arrive London @ 11:52p.m. (same day)

Please advise.

As you know, Enron=01,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way=

August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize th=

ENW=01,s share of this goal is $161,700.  While these are aggressive goals,=

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I=01,d like to have 100=

participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important=20
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has=20

=20
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I=01,ll need the=

the ENW organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision=

Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENW.  Your=20

community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENW by giving generously and=20
getting your pledges in by August 9th.

I have actually talked with these guys before.  More than a year ago I 
think.  I may have an old copy of their business plan.  The guy I talked to 
was Frank Levy, their CEO.  Just out of curiosity I would like to talk to 
them again to see if they have anything going.

Below are the EPMI proposed bid/offer spreads for EES.   These are very 
aggressive markets given the liquidity issues and regulatory uncertainty that 
still exist in the Eastern Interconnect.   There are no other counterparties 
in the market that will consistently make the proposed 2-ways.

The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott 
Healy's involvement in East Power initiatives:

Since Auburndale is effectively dead, Scott will no longer be involved on 
this project.
Scott will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site 
sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and 
Scott Healy getting personal performance credit.   If Ben elects to continue 
to use Scott's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between 
Ben, Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon.
Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott's 
continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton 
restructuring project.   If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to 
remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing 
agreement will be made between Jeff, Calger, and myself.    The value 
allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week.   If a fair 
value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition 
responsibility to another member of his origination team.

Chris - Do you agree with the above description?

I was trying to tell you that the blonde chick from Donna's group is down 
here.  The woman that's always whining about something.  She's driving me 
nuts.  That and the fact that I had a long meeting this morning with your 
other buddy, Chris Disable.  All we did was go in circles for about 45 
minutes.

How's your day going?

Lynn,

Have you heard anything from HR?  Is there any hope of me knowing something 
today?

Thanks,
Robin

Here are your positions.  I checked the conversion factors in our system.  I 
had the factors that you sent me, so I don't know why we are pulling 
different factors.  

Let me know how the position looks tonight.



Thanks,
Robin

Just kidding.

I didn't make it to the final test.  I didn't get out of here until after 
11:30.   So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon.  I still have 
one section left.  If I can get out of here at a decent time I'll finish it 
tonight.  Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch.  I have to finish it by 
tomorrow or I'll have to pay another $40!  So it's not safe to ride with me 
yet.  Not that my car ever really leaves the Enron garage!  

I'm glad you'll be getting out of here early.

I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a 
July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the 
same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are 
not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that 
had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  

BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)

GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9

GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3

GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)

If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic 
please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Robin

Here's the book request I spoke with you about.   This also needs to be added 
to the AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII, AND AGG-GASIV portfolios.  Please include as a 
separate portfolio named trader under the Lavorato Other region.  

Please let me know when this book is set up.

What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging 
out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I 
don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today.  

Hope you're having a good day.

I'm working hard as usual.   I saw you call...don't start screaming yet...I 
had an IT guy and several other people at my desk at the time.   I saw Me, 
Myself, and Irene too.  It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for 
stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the "sons" got on my 
nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little 
excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!!  

Well I better get busy.  Bye.

We still need to go to lunch sometime.

Lynn,

I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to 
arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling 
my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these 
dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the 
necessary arrangements.

Thank you for your help,

Frank forwarded you messaged about the error you were getting when trying to

were having problems loading your spreadsheets.  I might be able to help you

I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit 
looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today?  
So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and 
their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A 
manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the 
analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for 
him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his 
desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 
30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to 
come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 
7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, "Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't 
work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any 
questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further."  Funny, I 
didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I 
had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been 
nice to chew someone out.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Harry,

A little birdie told me today was your birthday!!  Unfortunately the little 
birdie gave me the wrong email address the first time or you would have had 
this email earlier.  Anyway, I wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday.  
Hope you have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.

Virendra,

Please check the set up of the book listed below.  I am having to manually 
override that post-id everyday.  

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you.

BOOKID  6/23/00 POSTID

INTRA-MKT3-PRC 818797

Thanks,
Robin

I'll send it tomorrow I promise.  I was going to work on it this weekend, but 
I couldn't get logged on and I've been a little busy this morning.  

Thanks for reminding me.

Hey,

I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that 
would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the 
blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were 
being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can 
probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I 
just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  

That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later,
Robin

That's fine.  Just let me know when you want to go.  But give me a few 
minutes, we're working on something.  It shouldn't take but about 10 minutes.

There was at least a third of it left, but it's in the trash now.  You're

 Virendra,

Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It 
is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily 
deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the 
current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that 
are fixed price gas daily deals.  

Thanks,
Robin

 I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat.  They were booked.  So I had 
to schedule it for Monday, and you'll love this.  I need to have it there by 
9am!!  So, if you're still willing to take me to drop it off I'll buy you 
breakfast and then we can go home and take naps.  

I'm leaving now.   Goodnight.

I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my 
parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right 
there's no hope for keeping me in line!  I think I'll just retire early and 
stay over there.  I would make a very good beach bum.  Of course with my 
complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have 
the soft and squishy part down).   I went shopping and spent way too much 
money this weekend buying things for my trip.  I'm having to buy clothes.   I 
don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes.  
I'm used to only two seasons, summer and suedo-winter.  It'll be spring over 
there and I've been checking the temperature.  It's been between the mid 40's 
and the low 70's.  I'm going to have to pack everything I own.  

I'm really sorry to hear about Megan's prognosis.  I know you hear this all 
the time but seriously, if there's anything at all I can do let me know.   
And I want you to know you guys are always in my prayers.

We should go to lunch sometime now that I'm working daylight hours.  

Talk to ya later,
RR

Hey guys,

Here are your positions for tonight.  We are off on FT CAN, but remember I 
included the Exotics text file in that position.  I am also attaching IM 
Canada.  

Please let me know how it looks as soon as possible so we can resolve 
variances before the system is shut down.

Thanks,
Robin

It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the 
weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and 
a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a 
lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  

I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So 
just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or 
in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

I told you about this Friday...you were probably just not awake enough to 
remember.  I'm going up there on Friday morning (after the checks) and coming 
back Sat. afternoon.  If I can get an apartment Friday I'll probably try to 
fly standby and come back earlier Sat.

Do you know anything about the Congress Plaza Hotel?  I was searching for

Hey,

What's going on?  I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring.  
Anything interesting in your world?  

It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.  I may come 
visit you before I go to my class.  I don't want to hang around down here 
until 6.   That is if you aren't too busy today.  

Talk to ya later,

Yeah, like this week.  And no I have no ideas...not even bad ones.  And I 
can't seem to find my catalog to order mom something.  I requested a new one 
but I don't know if we'll get it in time.  You need to just go wander around 
a home depot and find Dad some useless gadget.

Yeah, I know...I'm a grown woman I don't you telling me what to do! Just 
kididng.  I just completely forgot about it this weekend.  I meant to drop it 
off Sat. and then us go shopping.  Oh well.  If I don't get to it I'll have 
it done as soon as I get to Lake Charles.  The other stuff shouldn't take 
that long.  It's just a matter of actually making myself go do it.  

Call me when you get out of French.  I'll probably still be packing, so you 
can stop by and visit.

Lucy,

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be 
able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary 
on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

Nick,

There is a specific program that we are using to recruit, train, and mentor 
new traders on the gas and power desks.    The trading track program is being 
coordinated by Ted Bland.  I have forwarded him your resume.  Give him a call 
and he will fill you in on the details of the program.

Lucy,

 I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you 
email me his number I will call him.  
 I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him 
work orders for normal maintenance.

 I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary 
to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I 
 can guess your answer.

 I might stop by this Friday.

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 
to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  
Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

Let me know what you think.

 Got your message.  Good luck on the bike ride.

 What were you doing to your apartment?  Are you setting up a studio?

 The kids are back in school.  Otherwise just work is going on here.

Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay 
something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and 
a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock 
will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put 
up new rock then we will need to clarify.

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the 
negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the 
utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.

Johnnie,

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen

George,

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is 
the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
that day?  Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.

Lucy,

I got your email.  I didn't have time to finish it.  I will read it this 
weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's.  I am glad you are enjoying
the job.  This weekend I will mark up the lease and rules.  If I didn't 
mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and Wade.  
Have a good weekend and I will talk to you next week.

Richard,

 Compare your california production to the numbers in the 2000 California Gas 
Report.  It shows 410.  But again that might be just what the two utilities 
receive.

Bob,

 Any time tomorrow between 10 am and 1 pm would be good for looking at the 
plans.  As far as the TV's, what do you need me to do?  Do we need plasma 
screens or would regular monitors be just as good at a fraction of the cost.

By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star
Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson, 
a trader. "It makes the market for natural gas." 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting," McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

"It's the talk of the town here," he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

"It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

"I was getting worried," he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

"Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. "It's time to consider 
some changes."

Dave,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Phillip

George,

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the 
concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project 
are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 
million.  The components are as follows:

 Unit Cost, Site work, &
 builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million

 Land      1.15

 Interim Financing     .85

 Common Areas       .80

 Total     $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to 
get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A 
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce 
the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the 
seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is 
currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to 
the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market 
will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely 
increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost 
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He 
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we 
cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   
We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.

Phillip

Jacques,

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

Scott,

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Jaques,

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of "construction management" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

Phillip

Lucy,

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.  
  
  The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date
      2.  Lease expiration date
      3.  Rent
      4.  Deposit 
  
  If you have the info you can
  fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants
      2.  Workplace
      

  All the new leases should be the long form.



 The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.
  

 I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me 
tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and 
applications.  

Phillip

Jacques,

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit "B" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  
sellers to be executed.

Phillip

Jacques,

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Phillip

Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

Phillip

            The kids are into typical toys and games.  Justin likes power 
ranger stuff.  Kelsey really likes art.  Books would also be good.  

            We are spending Christmas in Houston with Heather's sister.  We 
are planning to come to San Marcos for New Years.  

            How long will you stay?  what are your plans?  Email me with 
latest happenings with you in the big city.

Don,

I was out last week.  Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to 
Mark Whitt in Denver.  

Let me know when you want to have the other meeting.

Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on Fred LaGrasta's desk 
or Enron marketers in New York where the customer is EES.  I don't understand 
why your people don't contact the desk directly.

Jeff,

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

Jeff,

 I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion 
adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner 
financing would still work.   Do you have an opinion?

 On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up?

 We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the 
spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to 
an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two 
files.

Lucy,

Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:

1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 
12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the 
beginning 
     of the two week period.  What is going on?

2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late? 


Here is a file for 12/08.

 I am going to be in Seguin this Saturday through Monday.  We can talk about 
a unit for Wade then.  I will call the bank again today to resolve 
authorization on the account.  Lets keep the office open until noon on

Jeff,

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

Phillip

Larry,

I met with a banker that is interested in financing the project.  They need 
the following:

Financial statements plus last two years tax returns.
Builders resume listing similar projects

The banker indicated he could pull together a proposal by Friday.  If we are 
interested in his loan, he would want to  come see the site.
If you want to overnight me the documents, I will pass them along.   You can 
send them to my home or office (1400 Smith, EB3210B, Houston, TX 77002).

The broker is Jim Murnan.  His number is 713-781-5810, if you want to call 
him and send the documents to him directly.

It sounds like the attorneys are drafting the framework of the partnership 
agreement.  I would like to nail down the outstanding business points as soon 
as possible.  

Please email or call with  an update.

Julie,

 The numbers for January are below:

  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000
  Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000
  Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000
  Estimated cost to unwind hedges         ($1,000,000) 

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no 
more than $1,500,000.  I want your input on
 how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or 
unwind costs?

Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which 
publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification 
on the language "the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in 
California"?

Did you receive the information about the San Marcos apartments.  I have left 
several messages at your office to follow up.  You mentioned that your plate

Jacques,

Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions.  Assuming that 
it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents 
need to be
completed to convey the partnership done.  I need to work with the engineer 
and architect to get things moving.  I am planning on  writing a personal 
check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.  Let me know if 
there is a reason I should not do this.

Thanks for all your help so far.  Between your connections and expertise in 
structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.

Lucy,

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

Phillip

I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind 
of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going 
to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.   
 What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
 Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.

Thanks,

Phillip

Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Phillip

George,

 I received the drawings.  They look good at first glance.  I will look at 
them in depth this weekend.  The proforma was in the winmail.dat format which 
I cannot open.  Please resend in excel or a pdf format.  If you will send it 
to pallen70@hotmail.com, I will be able to look at it this weekend.  Does 
this file have a timeline for the investment dollars?  I just want to get a 
feel for when you will start needing money.

Daryl,

Here is the file that includes the proforma, unit costs, and comps.  This 
file was prepared by the builder/developer.


The architect that has begun to work on the project is Kipp Flores.  They are 
in Austin.

Thank you for your time this evening.  Your comments were very helpful.  I 
appreciate you and Greg taking a look at this project.

Mark,  Please review my attached change to the confirm.  This makes it clear 
that if we don't like their changes to the Master we will not accept them and 
the existing Master still governs.  If acceptable I will forward back to AEC.

Russell,  AEC is reviewing the Master and indicated they would have comments 
within a week or so.  The plan is now to execute this confirm and follow up 
with the new master.  The credit language that was in the earlier version has 
been removed.

Attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes.   Please note the 
following:

1.  I added back the limitation on damage provision I originally had.  We 
need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only 
remedies.
2.  Changed both Seller and Buyer Minimum Volume Obligations to be consistent 
with each other.

The amendment for the Powder River contract should reflect the same.  Please 
contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you would like to discuss.

don't get stuck with their cost.  Might want to ask for cash up front with a 
make whole once the facilities are completed.  I haven't made any changes to 
reflects.  Thoughts?

How are you doing?  Still up to your eyeballs in premarital bliss.  Football 
season is getting close.  Can't wait for some tailgating extravaganza.

Paul,  I am still here.  Where the heck are you?  I guess you are back in the 
States by now.  What are you guy's up to?  How many kids do you have now?

As for Lisa and I, we are still DINKs (Double Income No Kids) in Houston.  I 
am officially an attorney now working in the corporate legal department of 
Enron Capital & Trade Resources.  I had to turn in my pocket protector when I 
left my engineering job.  Lisa actually just joined Enron, so now it is all 
in the family.  We are  doing good.  We bought a 50 yr old house near 
downtown about 1 year ago and have been restoring it ever since.  It really 
is amazing how all that Bob Villa watching is now paying dividends.  I am 
considering getting a tool belt with my name engraved on it.  We are both 
doing good.  Life for me is good, now that I don't have to go to school in 
the evening or study for the bar exam.  I am just enjoying my free time now.

I still keep up with George and Ernie occasionally.  George still lives in 
Austin and is single.  I visit him a couple of times a year.  You wouldn't 
believe it.  He still has the same furniture in his apartment that he had in 
college.  Kind of like stepping into a time warp.  Ernie just finished 
getting his MBA at UT this spring.  He will be working in San Antonio for 
Frito Lay (no doubt designing a chip that won't break when you dip it).  He 
now has a little girl with another kid on the way.  I think due sometime this 
summer.  He has really changed since undergrad.  A responsible young man now.

How are Mom and Pop Bieraugel doing? (Is the Big 10 going to take it in the 
shorts this year?)  Are they still in the Washington area?  Lisa had talked 
to your mom about a year ago when she was trying to track you down for my 
graduation party.  Sounded like all was well in the Bieraugel household.  I 
think she said John was in Alaska?

Anyway, drop me a note when you get a chance.  It is really great to hear 
from you again.  We need to keep in touch.

Gerald,

Jaime,  Attached is a firm sales agreement form which ECT utilizes in  North 
America.  A lot of the form may not be relevant given the fact that (i) Pemex 
is both the seller and transporter and (ii)  unless you are near the border, 
there are no alternative sources to Pemex.  However, it is a good starting 
point.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Confidential Work Material - Attorney Client Privilege


Attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to Wildhorse 
concerning the Gathering Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota 
production is committed.  Please review and provide comments.

To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement:

1.  Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday.  Brett also 
forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse.  The 
correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings 
conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse.  No demands were made by Enogex and 
no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse.  Brett stated that the 
Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because 
the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications.  
Enogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or 
Questar.  I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release 
the gas.  He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo 
negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse.  

2.  I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa.  Nothing really 
useful.  There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area 
called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought 
these assets were in a state of economic viability decline.  Unfortunately 
this letter was not directed to Enogex.  However, the draft letter takes that 
position with Wildhorse.

3.  I am securing local consul out of Denver.  I want someone intimately 
familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective 
to be involved.  We may need to seek a declaratory order.   We have run into 
to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown.  
Should have this resolved on Monday.

4.  Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the 
declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse.  

This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas.  However, to 
reiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right 
to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement.  The fact that 
the Entrada Gas is not in spec. with the downstream pipelines for inerts, 
allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in 
default.

Ken,  Attached is the Northwest Pipeline FA with my comments incorporated. I 
have attached both a clean and a redlined version.  Please note that I added 
a cap to the total facilities costs.  This is a recommendation.  To the 
extent we have no cap however,  Crescendo is at risk for all costs they 
incur.  Cost overruns could be significant.  Please review and let me know if 
you have any questions.

purchase.  Please take one last look.  If OK I will forward the ECS purchase

The ECT confirms still have the TW West Texas Pool as being the point at

Hello,  I am an attorney at Enron North America Corp.  I have recently been 
asked to coordinate our hiring of summer clerks.  Monica Jordan previously 
had handled these duties and informed me that she had used the HBA Minority 
Committee through which to do some of our hiring of clerks.  

I am looking for information concerning this program; such as how it 
operates, when it meets. etc.  Any information you could supply would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Gerald Nemec

John,  Attached are the case historys for the two cases.  Note:

Followed - means the court followed the holding in the case cited
Dissenting Opinion - means the dissenting justices referenced the case only 
(not really relevant)
Distinguished - court didn't follow the holding of the case or simply found 
that the facts of the two cases were different.

Hope this helps.

Ozzie,  Steve Van Hooser forwarded two agreement for electric service from 
CP&L for the Elizabethtown and the Lumbertown cogen facilities for my 
review.  I have reviewed the documents and they are standard tariff type 
service agreements.  There are two items to which I would like to draw your 
attention.  These deals look to have a 10 year term since they are being 
served from Transmission Service.  

1.  If Customer terminate earlier, there would be a termination payment equal 
to the loss in salvage value of the facilities used to serve the Customer.  
Not sure what this value is, but might be significant, depending on what 
facilities CP&L would install to serve these plants.

2.  There is a minimum bill each month that Customer would have to pay, even 
if there was no usage of power by Customer.

If you are OK with these issues, I will initial the agreements and forward 
these  to you for signature. 

Please contact me at x33512 if you would like to discuss.

Attached is the Gas Purchase Agreement between Enron Compression Services 
Company and Enron North America Corp.  This backs the gas deal between ECS 
and ECC, LLC.  The pricing and terms are identical.

Note:  In the Kachina deal we used Enron Natural Gas Marketing instead of ENA 
for this gas deal.  After discussions with tax and accounting, there were no 
objections to using ENA in this deal.


Please review.

Hi Melissa,

Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email 
since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they 
keep you busy at V&E.

Yes, I do work for Enron.  I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas 
and power origination.   I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on a 
couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.  Terry Yates and 
David Keyes.  Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at Enron 
in our Global Finance Legal Group.  

Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys 
pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big place, 
but I might know them.

Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to location?

In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann 
and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good 
friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip!

Dolores,

I was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to 
the analyst program and how they affect me.  Specifically, I wanted to get 
some more information on the Third-Year Analyst Rotation and its requirements 
(as I am currently half-way through my second rotation), as well as the 
different tracks available within the program.  If you could direct to the 
proper individual(s) I would really appreciate it.  

Thanks,
Susan Scott

Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft 
form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to 
you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new 
company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes 
to the attached.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have 
questions.

Attached is the final version of the Interconnect Agreement.



I've changed Section 4.2 in accordance with our e-mail discussion.  
Additionally, I've filled in the blanks for POI# and date of commencement of 
construction, and added an Exhibit A (and a reference to Exhibit A in the 
definition of "Facilities") listing what will be installed.

Darin, kindly fill in the appropriate contact information on page 11, have 
the agreement executed by EPFS in duplicate originals, and return both 
originals to me.  I will return a fully executed original to you.  Lorraine 
Lindberg will be forwarding you wire transfer information for the payments 
that are due from EPFS upon execution.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Lorraine 
will be on vacation as of tomorrow.

Thank you,

    For October 19: Put the obsession and dedication back into your job,
                     health, and daily life. Stressful matters beyond your 
control have leached away
                     much of the excitement that makes life enjoyable. Use 
this Mercury retro
                     period to reinvent your work philosophy and improve your 
health and lifestyle.
                     The resources and relief you seek are available, but you 
may be expected to
                     kowtow and kiss butt to get what you need. Are you 
willing -- or not? I can't
                     blame you if your high standards won't allow anything to 
compromise your
                     vision. But if you're feeling pragmatic, use the next 3 
weeks to cook up an
                     agreement you can live with.

I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Morgan lawyers.

Here is the quick & dirty.

None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not 
placed in service by a certain date.  The respective obligations of the 
parties do not commence until the facilities are "tested and placed in 
service."  We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the 
facilities were in service.  The compressor has since been taken down because 
of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.  
EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do 
not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.  Based on our 
experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.  Today, 
we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not 
exceed our existing capacity.  Nominations are expected to exceed existing 
capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.

Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be 
best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are 
not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our 
best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.    When the 
compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know.  
The downside:  we get no reservation charge at all.  (estimated loss:  
$25,000/month)
The upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers.

From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to 
revoke our "in-service" announcement.  When summer weather kicks in, we'll 
probably have to allocate every day.  On our EBB we will have to give some 
reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an 
explanation anyway).  Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be 
triggered.  
The downside:  shippers will never trust us again.  Also, we could be subject 
to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was "in 
service" when we knew it was not.  
The upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at 
least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent 
deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of 
longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer.  (In 
July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not 
delivered).  We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs 
full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption 
in mind.

Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a 
memo for wider distribution, let me know.  For now, I think it's important to 
get a decision on one of the above options.  The longer we wait to get 
information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will 
be.

Here's a draft of a research memo on options.  While I am hopeful that we can 
overcome FERC's policy on reservation of capacity, our arguments obviously 
need to be developed a little more before we can do that.  I know the 
business folks are anxious to hear our strategy.  I would appreciate your 
comments on the attached.

Hey Corey,

So he's back in town now...The question is what do I do about that?  Should 
I:  A) Completey ignore him and pretend like there was never anything between 
us or B) Call him out and confront him with his own cowardess.  I am 
completely torn on the issue and have actually felt physically ill over the 
situation the last two days.  Help!!!

Just so you know, I spoke with the group this morning about contracting 
practices and they agreed to do the Christine/Susan/dealmaker huddle prior to 
sending any contracts out.  It helps that I have Kevin's support on this.  I 
think it will work fine.

TK is going make sure Tenaska gets credited.  The difference between actual 
and billed amounts is very little.

Thanks for your attention to this last week.

I found the picture from Tin Hall the other night and that guy at Whataburger 
was definitely one of the "cute cowboys."  How weird is that?  Anyway, hope 
you're flight home and immediate transition to the classroom went smoothly.  
I guess I'll be seeing you in about two weeks and by that time, hopefully, 
I'll know more about my London prospects.

Dear Judge Biren:

 Transwestern Pipeline Company will be offering the following exhibits:

 1.  Prepared Direct Testimony of Jeffery C. Fawcett on Behalf of 
Transwestern Pipeline Company in Support of the Comprehensive Settlement 
Agreement (Exhibit 12, incorporating Exhibit JCF-1) and 

 2.  Prepared Rebuttal Testimony of Jeffery C. Fawcett on Behalf of 
Transwestern Pipeline Company in Support of the Comprehensive Settlement 
Agreement (Exhibit 17).  

 Transwestern estimates it will need less than 10 minutes for direct 
testimony.  Transwestern does not at this time intend to cross-examine any 
witnesses; however, it reserves the right to request a reasonable amount of 
time to examine witnesses on issues affecting Transwestern to the extent that 
any party's live testimony differs from or conflicts with its prepared 
testimony.

Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and 
my initial impressions.  Let's talk more about how to approach the issue 
after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.

12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:

Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to 
provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an 
interruptible basis.

Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.

Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).

The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.

2/18/93 letter amendment:

Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 
200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and 
quantity of at least 140).  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide 
firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.

9/25/95 letter amendment:

Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San 
Juan expansion is effective.

My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 
250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure 
requirements.  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if 
accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can 
argue impossibility of performance.  Also, we could avoid the obligation 
because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force 
majeure.  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to 
have gotten hotter over the years.  

The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in 
January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say 
we should have known by now).  Burlington might try to argue that we have an 
absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive 
system modifications.  That argument is not a very strong one because the 
agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly 
describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.

I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at B&N and Territory Ahead.  Mum, 
only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in 
my work address for the other.  (Really missed the boat on tennis clothes.  
You have to act early.  Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his 
catalog to order FALL 2000 Nike stuff!)  Karin, I am probably going to make a 
stop at Macy's or Neiman's makeup counter at some point so I could pick up 
the Estee Lauder for MeeMaw* if you know the shade.  

Bill's b-day is today; if you want to send a message his e-mail is 
75261.151@compuserve.com.

That's all this elf knows.

Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an "out of the money" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then "move the market" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak 
dude" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.  
Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you 
can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of 
you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.  
Cheers.

Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow 
acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles 
interconnect with SoCal.  Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles 
but does not extend the same privilege to TW.    

I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El 
Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the 
constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South 
Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and 
letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using 
their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this 
out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it 
with Jeff when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.  Call if you have any 
questions or comments to discuss!  

S.

I haven't sent a quote in quite some time, but this one really spoke to me.

Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinctions. No dignity, no
learning, no force of character, can make any stand against good wit. -Ralph

I just finished having lunch with Tobin and he filled me in a bit about this 
morning's meeting.  I don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc.  
but I wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation.  
Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight 
of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in 
the best and most open manner possible.  In no way can or should your conduct 
be called into question.  Bearing that in mind any criticism that was 
expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.  I am 
sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those 
being criticized.  Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible 
opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will 
inevitably open.  There isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great 
things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when 
they come along (which is exactly what you've done).  

Keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions.

On Friday the Commission issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) 
TW's tariff sheets for acquiring PNM capacity, and calling for a technical 
conference.  The Commission stated that while TW's proposal may be in the 
public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised 
by Dynegy in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order 
does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to 
include:  whether TW will, in effect, become a marketer for PNM's services, 
whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion 
of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Commission noted that while PNM has 
certificate (i.e., public convenience & necessity) authority to transport gas 
in interstate commerce, PNM will "have to either explain how it has 
appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate 
commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Commission."   Lorraine 
has forwarded a copy of the order to PNM so that they can begin taking the 
appropriate steps.

I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell 
you when I have further information.  If you would like a copy of the order, 
let me know.

This may appear to be somewhat of a random email, but I assure you there 
exist some semblence of reason.  I remembered you mentioning that neither you 
nor Pat have ever made a pilgramige to Blanco's.  So...I thought I should let 
you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the Big B.  
Anyway it should be pretty good.  Music starts at 9:00.

The attached document shows my proposed changes to Universal's agreement in 
redlining.  I tried not to over-lawyer or make this overly complicated, but 
in my view this needed a lot of basic cleanup.  Many of my changes are simply 
to make the language more accurate (for example, in the use of defined 
terms).  

In a couple of places, I have questions:  1) In the second opening paragraph, 
I don't know whether it is possible to attach the Proposal as an exhibit; if 
not, ignore my change.  2) Section 4.a.  -- their provision for an adjustment 
seemed a little unusual to me but it could work in favor of either party, so 
I left it in.  If you don't like it, let me know.  3)  In Section 5, I just 
tried to simplify the billing procedure in case of termination.  Let me know 
if this does not agree with your intent.

Please call me with your comments, and let me know how you would like to 
proceed.

If I remember correctly, we'll need to paper the additional Sempra capacity, 
either with an amendment or a separate agreement.  I'll be in the office by

Still need to add a few things, but most of it's already there.  The only 
things missing are the GD files we created and the GD FOM valuation problem 
that I've been working on with Shouan and Jeremy (there was a bug in the 
code).

    For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive,
                   and unlimited this month that you're capable of
                   almost anything! (You've privately believed that
                   the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This
                   month, your incredible adaptability and powers of
                   persuasion help you shed the status quo and
                   break out of the corral. Unless you catch your
                   foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People
                   are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and
                   conversation. (Don't forget: Oprah Winfrey is an
                   Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and
                   provoke others to investigate things they may
                   have taken for granted. Speak up during the first
                   week, especially if it's to announce you're
                   starting a new venture. Business travel is likely
                   during the first and third weeks, especially if
                   contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is
                   actually enjoyable this month and can open your
                   eyes to fresh horizons. Aquarius. . . you've
                   dragged your tin cup across the bars long
                   enough. I smell a prison break. . . .

In my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially I am 
proposing a fun-filled Friday night to those of you who I feel would 
appreciate it most, or at least have any interest what-so-ever.  This Friday 
at 6:30 p.m. Pavel Kogan will be performing with the Houston Symphony at 
Jones Hall.  All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, 
which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a 
piece.  My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an 
outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent 
restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish 
off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones 
Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.  Bear in 
mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one 
of you.  While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's 
plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one 
evening.  Please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such 
an outing.  

"And in the end it's not the years in your life that count.  It's the life in 
your years."  - - Abraham Lincoln

Aquarius - Horoscope
  Friday, September 8, 2000
  by Astronet.com

                                      Powerful forces are at work to 
challenge you on a new level of association.
                                      Travel may be part of the new game 
plan. Investigate the possibility of a move
                                      to a new locale. You might consider a 
home away from home as well. This is
                                      the time to express a latent talent or 
learn a new technique in relation to
                                      investments. You may have to work out 
some conflicts in a relationship,
                                      however. Don't let hurt feelings 
prevent you from making a new start.

   I'd told my theory to my friend Linda, who wanted to be a social scientist 
and was always coming up with theories herself.  I'd concluded that breasts 
were to sex what pillows were to sleep.  "Guys might think they want a 
pillow, but they'll sleep just as well without one."
     She'd said, "Guys will sleep anywhere if they're really tired."

Main Entry: al?tru?ism
Pronunciation: 'al-tru-"i-z&m
Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, 
oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter
Date: 1853
1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others

We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to 
get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him 
by consuming
so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your 
typical response to this is "I am the most altruistic person."  I am sure you 
recognize the hypocrisy 
laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not 
care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes 
only that his acts benefit
those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to "concerned 
individual".                       

But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might 
like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. 
Smith 
Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the 
film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, 
extremely unselfish
young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C.  
The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of 
the Century list,
and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..

FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply 
haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both 
receive my next 
brilliant composition.  I must say I was tempted to remove you given your 
complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of 
appearances.

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant 
changes include:

- added definition of Counterparty
- added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect 
compliance with 154.202
- included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated 
rate
- added an example of how options will work

I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option 
fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the 
fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the 
Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate 
because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be 
nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from 
the market.  

Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will 
have Janet call to determine your availability.

                              *An Army grunt stands in the rain with a 35 
pound pack on his back, 15 lb. weapon in hand, after having
                              marched 12 miles, and says, "This is shit!"

                              *An Army Airborne Ranger stands in the rain 
with a 45 lb. pack on his back, weapon in hand, after having
                              jumped from an airplane and marched 18 miles, 
and says with a smile, "This is good shit!" 

                              *A Navy SEAL lies in the mud, 55 LB pack on his 
back, weapon in hand, after swimming 10 miles to shore,
                              crawling through a swamp and marching 25 miles 
at night past the enemy positions, says with a grin, "This
                              really is great shit."

                              *A Marine, up to his nose in the stinking, 
bug-infested mud of a swamp with a 65 LB pack on his back and
                              a weapon in both hands after jumping from an 
aircraft at high altitude, into the ocean, swimming 12 miles to
                              the shore, killing several alligators to enter 
the swamp, then crawling 30 miles through the brush to assault
                              an enemy camp, says, "I love this shit."

Spoke with Steve about the swap question.  He wants to talk with you about 
this before circling back to Knippa.  If you don't hear from him, and want to 
call him, his # is 281-350-8441.

Re. TW's exposure if we authorize ECS to lock in too early:

If TW defaults under the CSA, it must hold ECS harmless with regard to 
expenses incurred by ECS in the assignment of the electric supply agreement 
and pay ECS whatever is owed under the agreement.  No other specific damages 
are addressed, and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of 
consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages.  (Section 9.2 
provides for reimbursement for ECS's reasonable costs in providing 
Compression Services, but only in the event TW uses its FERC out.)  The Gas 
Conversion Agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event 
of default by TW under the CSA, and obligates TW to reimburse ECS for ECS's 
costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas 
volumes to be delivered to ECS under the agreement.  

Other questions -- let  me know.

Hey,
 
I know you are monumentally busy this week, but if you get five minutes today 
shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the Associates 
below.  They are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would 
boost my B.S. factor would be much appreciated.  I seem to remember you 
mentioning John Massey on a couple of occasions but I have, albeit very 
rarely, been known to be wrong.  Hope your day is going well and that you 
aren't having to carry Darren too much.

-- I finally watched the movie last night.  I laughed, I cried...it became a 
part of me.  Honestly though, it was a very funny flick.  So did John or 
Fritz pass along the "Bible" to you?  (Whoever it was you can thank them for 
me.)

First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem 
with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of 
$650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use 
and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is 
reasonable.

I'll try to answer all your questions:

Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to
make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse 
as
we would be removing light items for heavier items. 

A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor, 
there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a 
waterbed, though!

Q.  The stove is a bit problematic... 

A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give 
the appliance folks a call.  

Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed? 

A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any 
internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.

Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for 
sure?

A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and 
running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.

Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric? 

A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more 
economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and 
towels dry than with electric!
If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.

Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as 
the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?

A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern 
would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy 
except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old 
stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless 
you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.

Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover?

A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be 
some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at 
the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.

The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and 
helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use 
that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to 
park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors 
working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do 
you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?

As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking 
the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get 
everything done then if that's okay with y'all.

Call if you have further questions!

You try and do something nice, keep people informed and involved and it just 
gets thrown back in your face.

That's okay though because, "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and dog-gonnit 
people like me."

Gwen,

Dolores Muzzy gave me your name as a contact for information regarding the 
redesigned Analyst/Associate programs.  I am currently half-way through my 
second rotation with the Analyst program and was hoping to get a better idea 
of the different opportunities available to me upon completion of my current 
rotation.  Although six months seems like a fair amount of time to plan my 
next move, I know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself 
uncertain as to what action to take to insure that I am heading in the right 
direction to meet my current goals.  I would appreciate the opportunity to 
meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest 
convenience.  If there is another individual you feel would be a better 
contact for me at this point I would be happy to meet with them as well. 

Thank you,

Susan Scott

Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to 
FERC decisions.

In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ? 61,102, reh'g denied, 75 
FERC ? 61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC 
approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that 
they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not 
double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.

In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ? 61,394 (1997), the 
Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes 
operationally available for various reasons from time to time.

But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of 
"pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is 
available" that I thought existed.

Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control 
agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At 
this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested 
by the Commission.

I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is 
checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW 
Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I 
do not expect the agreement to change significantly.

Your "courtesy copy" of the draft I sent to MK, Drew and Shelley.  We'll put 
our heads together and come up with a final version.

Hi Mum!  Sorry I have not called you back.  I have been out late every nite 
and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.  Am on the trading floor 
this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.  But I'll give you a call 
this afternoon.
Our little bar examinee is alive and well.  They've changed the schedule so 
the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.  She joined me and my work crowd 
last night at La Griglia and we ordered champagne.  So I've already 
celebrated appropriately!
What do you think of my Destin idea?
talk to you soon
Love,
Sooz

While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of 
these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now 
more appropriate than ever.

One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when 
they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's 
level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause 
irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is 
violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in 
this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born 
that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times 
that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the 
above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather 
that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.  
I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing 
and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a 
great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and 
statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes 
listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of 
people whom you respect.)

To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically 
reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and 
self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, 
cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always 
be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and 
trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger.

Just to forewarn you two, it looks like Darren (Ted's buddy) is going to be 
in London for a few months working on a project.  When I mentioned you two 
were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses.  No 
pressure for you guys to do anything with him, but I do like the guy and 
think when I come over we will definitely have to do something with him (and 
Nick too of course...maybe the same night, that whole "kill two birds with 
one stone concept").  

Sue

Side-note:  I'm am dying of curiosity as to why Darren is going to London for 
a project and Ted is trading corn here.  Maybe I'll find out before Darren 
leaves.  
       Who knows, maybe if you all see Darren over there you can find out 
what the heck happened with our once so promising Mr. Noble.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Kori Loibl has offered up her apartment as a 
Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her 
boyfriend and  Mo "the bomb" Sanchez and her fianc,e John.  Don't know if you 
guys have any interest, but the offer's open.  Either way, we'll have to find 
someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the 
Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).

Susan

Bryan, 

Are you still having a great time?  So what is Bali like?  The only images I 
can summon are Gauguin's paintings, but weren't those of Tahiti?  

Things are pretty good here.  Lots of Christmas parties, lots of Christmas 
cheer, etc.  Not a whole lot going on at the office, for a change.  Really, 
though, I think I would much rather be in Bali.  

Take care.

S.

Glen, at page 1020 of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, the judge 
asked you and Norm Pedersen to work with various other parties to develop an 
exhibit reflecting capacity at the California border.  The judge mentioned 
she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning, so I am surprised that you 
did not attempt to contact me to get Transwestern's input or at least to let 
us review the exhibit.  I would like to review the exhibit as soon as 
possible.  I am out of town but you can either e-mail it to me or fax it to 
941-466-2198 (before 3 pm PDT).  Also, I should be reachable on my mobile 
phone (713-494-5002) or by voice mail at my office (713-853-0596).

Here is the draft for distribution.  In addition to the customer-friendly 
"looking forward to meeting with our business partners" language I know 
you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following:

Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of 
Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.  We are providing these 
draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a 
good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to 
filing.  The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees 
only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your 
company.  Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in 
final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management 
approval prior to filing with the Commission.

Kyle,

I want you to know how much getting your email today meant to me.  I was 
hoping to be able to respond with the same kind of care and consideration you 
showed, but - as you can see from the time on this email - today has been a 
bit on the rough side.  I will continue my thoughts tomorrow when I have more 
time to gather them, but until then I wanted you to know that I did get the 
email and that it contained quite possibly some of the kindest and most 
touching things ever said to me.  And, please know that you would never, ever 
be put in one of my stalker catagories...you could never be lumped in any 
catagory with the SP's of the world.

Susan

As for the good-bye, I would have to give it high marks as well.

Hey Julie,

I just got back from London Tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from 
the jet lag.  I had an absolutely incredible time while I was over there and 
was even able to go into the Enron office for a while.  One of the guys I 
knew here in Houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was 
there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.  Since 
I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in London 
Emily and I pretty much just hung out.  We went out to eat Friday night and 
then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish 
and chips).  Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to 
various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.  
Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then 
had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Emily's.  Hope 
everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place 
was a success.  I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to 
meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.

Susan

PS - I think you're right about the California men.  I am currently in 
contact with about three of them and they all have issues.  Although, I still 
think Ted takes the cake.

O.K.  Just wanted to see if we're still on for Saturday night.  Let me know 
if anyone else wants to come because I think I'm just going to order the 
tickets today over the phone or on the internet.  Also, I was trying to 
remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's.  I 
think it was around $15, so if it's okay with you I'll just pay for your 
ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email 
and cut you a check for that amount (I know I'm very delinquent).  I promise 
I'm good for the money.  Also, was wondering if you're still interested in 
the Bruce Cockburn concert on the 11th.  Just let me know.  Hope your having 
a wonderful day.

Just wanted to thank you all for showing my parents such a good time last 
night.  They really enjoyed meeting you and finally being able to put some 
faces with the names.  At one point I believe my Dad even stated, "I love 
this place...now we'll have to come here every Wednesday." (An idle threat 
though don't worry).  They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the 
topical conversational range ever present at "Steak Night".  Our own, though 
at times juvenile and base, version of the Algonquian Table.

Now on to the "food for thought"...I had a hard time narrowing down my 
selections today so please bear with the number of quotes and their seemingly 
unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more).

"Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, 
misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life 
with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a 
sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow." -- 
Dorothy Thompson

"One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary 
form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school 
and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of 
the value of the result to the community." -- Albert Einstein 

"Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but 
among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh." --W.H. Auden

"Learn to give yourself what you wish you could get from somebody else." -- 
Steven Ouellette

"The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words 
return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy." -- Florence Scovel 
Shinn

"We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of 
regret or disappointment." -- Jim Rohn

Here's the letter with some slight changes.  
Drew and I thought it better to mention the interconnect for regulatory

Lorraine -- answers to some of your questions.

Questar Line 90 Company purchased the facilities from ARCO for a total of $38 
million.  At the time it made its FERC application, Questar Southern Trails' 
estimated cost of 1) purchasing the facilities from Line 90 Company and 2) 
converting the line to gas service via the construction of compressor 
stations and various pipeline replacements, realignments and extension:  155 
million.  I assume you want more detail so I'll have Mike Vannorden get the 
relevant exhibits.  

Southern Trails proposed to install 7 new compressor stations.  These are 
detailed on Table 1 in their application cover letter (on my desk if you want 
to take a look).  The various pipeline modifications they proposed to make 
are described in some detail on pages 12 - 16.

Available capacity:  120,000 Dth/day in West Zone; 87,500 in East Zone.

I will have Mike send you exhibits I believe might be of interest.

Rob,
Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last 
paragraph.  You know that this language was negotiated by and between 
SoCalGas and Edison.  My main concern is that its very, very open ended...  
almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties.

Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my 
neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!  Several of my neighbors were 
also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.  I don't know whether 
we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.  Jose and Gigi's 
party was attended by more kids than ever.  There were a lot of West U 
parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin 
American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.  We 
did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi 
with the pinatas, and got home around 7.  The traffic on I-45 was really 
starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did.

Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit.

Love,
Sooz

The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas 
under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or 
periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar 
quarter.  Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned 
maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that 
gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.  

Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as "maintenance," I'm 
not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as 
the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.  I am also not 
completely comfortable calling this "force majeure" because part of the 
tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either 
party; however, since the definition does include "binding order of any court 
or governmental authority," we could possibly say this is force majeure if 
we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety 
rule.  (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure 
notice.)  If not, we can argue that since this is not "maintenance," but 
simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner, 
the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction 
provisions.  In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under 
ordinary contract law.  

I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is 
going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed 
itself of the reservation charge reduction.  I recommend we give shippers 
reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate 
plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.

Please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions.

John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock 
receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement 
TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.  My understanding is that 
physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will 
simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a 
formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will "charge" itself for the 
transfer is $0.  

This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with 
the above scenario.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call 
me (x30596).

Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate 
pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it 
must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some 
other basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that 
capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did not 
find any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware, 
the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up 
with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory 
basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to 
its shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and 
there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlying 
presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is 
awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting 
discriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says this 
even though it should be obvious.

Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA 
(doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. 
basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers 
of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the 
capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we 
will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to 
participate in the auction process.  

Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the 
effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the 
Enrononline process.

Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we 
could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for 
determining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.  
In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  "The 
Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season 
provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid 
evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing 
different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different 
transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology 
before the bidding process begins."  The only problem is I am not sure we 
have that "flexibility" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post 
a different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some 
language allowing us to do so.

I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what 
you write I'd be happy to.

Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...

The problem:

As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the 
following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: "if the rate 
bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be 
the maximum tariff rate," and the additional frustrating language "[a]ll 
available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."  At our 
last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could 
capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate 
to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount 
of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any 
index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I 
have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of 
other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum 
rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.  
However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical 
change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW 
lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.

Why the problem exists (you may already know):

Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in 
the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the 
Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for 
negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a 
cost-of-service based tariff rates.  "[T]he availability of a recourse 
service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that 
the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline 
unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
recourse rate mitigates market power."  

The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest 
rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its 
transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly 
not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper 
willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely 
because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  "When there are 
more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the 
pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either 
the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata 
basis if required by its tariff."  The example cited by the Commission:  If a 
pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one 
who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a 
negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata 
basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some 
other allocation method such as lottery).  

When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added 
the statement that "if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the 
rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."  Presumably we had 
concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order 
to receive negotiated rate authority.  

Solutions??

I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language 
outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been 
chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I 
keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is 
where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  
Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the 
recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still 
have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic 
warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive 
proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.

Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more 
than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  
We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more 
than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, 
despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely 
we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be 
able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But 
I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that 
recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either 
of you seen anything to the contrary?  

I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to 
discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to 
discuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few 
minutes.  Thanks.

Fifth grade assignment

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess."  "And what's the moral of 
the story?" Asked the teacher.  "Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!"  "Very good," said the teacher.  

"Now, Lucy?"  

"Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched."  "That was a fine story Lucy."

"Johnny do you have a story to share?"  

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands."
"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking."

Lexi,

I completely forgot to turn in my expense report from last months recruiting 
trip.  Things around here have been absolutely crazy, as I'm sure they have 
been for you.  In addition to the attached file below I am forwarding the 
hard copy to your office.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to 
help with the process.



Thanks,
Susan

Attached are the latest drafts of the Coral Energy synthetic storage deal 
starting in April.  These Transaction Agreements are, as Gregg says, 
Nicor-esque.  However, I did remove the secondary delivery point concept.  I 
did leave in the $0.20 and $0.25 administrative fee.

Susan, 

I just returned from a four month maternity leave.  I have not seen executed 
documents.  Attached are the final version of the documents on the system.  I 
will track down the signed versions (if they were returned by EOTT during my 
absence) and send you copies.

Gregg, 

As we discussed... I would add the following provision at the end of the 
second sentence in Section VIII A. (3):

;provided however, in the event that Seller's invoice to Buyer is delayed due 
to Buyer not providing Seller the ANR information in the time period 
specified in Section V (2), the due date for payment of the Demand Charge 
shall be the twenty fifth (25th) day following the service month.

Cary,  

I have reviewed Mary's comments on the Nipsco contract.  She makes some good 
points and it would be nice for Nipsco to make those changes.  If Nipsco will 
not make the changes, I still think it is acceptable for enovate to sign the 
agreement.

I have asked Pat Radford to put the enovate Master Firm and the enovate GISB 
in Attorney's Forms.  Until she is able to do that, you can find these forms 
as follows:

1) The Master Firm is at o/common/legal/sdickso/enovate/enovate master 
firm.doc
2) The GISB is at o/common/legal/sdickso/enovate/enovateGISB.doc

Please let me know if you have any problems locating these documents.

Renee,

How are things going?  I ran into Jennifer Minnis at a GISB meeting.  She 
said that you are not doing Broadband anymore.  What are you doing?  When she 
told me that, it was apparent to me that I have not talked to you in a 
while.

Attached is a draft of the services agreement with Garden State Paper.  
Please do not forward this to them.  We need to discuss a couple of things 
after you have read the agreement.  I also need to add a little bit more 
legal boilerplate.  Please call me so that we may discuss.

Heather,

I am glad to hear you (and your car) are o.k.  We did not have any problems.  
Those pictures are amazing!  The video of I-10 was unbelievable.  Dan and 
Marianne went to I-10 and saw the flooding in person.  He said the video on 
tv did not really show how bad it was.  Is there an estimate on when B  & P 
will be back in their offices?  It would be nice for you to have a couple of 
days off.

Stacy

P.S. I heard that Monica Jordan Richards left Enron and went to Entergy.

Donna:
 
Jeff Hodge asked that I respond to your e-mail.  

ENA does use the GISB contract to conduct its "spot" business.  By "spot", I 
mean interruptible gas deals of any length and firm deals one month or less 
in duration.  Enron also has its own form of spot agreement that we use.  I 
have attached a copy of that agreement.

We do try to negotiate some special provisions into each GISB.  Our current 
version of the special provisions is included in the GISB agreement that is 
attached.  I do not know of any company that uses the GISB as-is.

We do not use the GISB for firm deals that are greater than one month in 
duration.  For those deals, we use our Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement that I have attached.

If you need copies of actual confirmations, Bob Bowen or Ellen Wallumrod 
would be able to give you examples.  Form confirmations are at the back of 
each of the agreements attached.

If you need additional information, please let me know.

Rae, 

I am not sure if Jeff Hodge has already volunteered me.  If he has not, I 
would like to volunteer to be on the drafting committee.  I am not available 
May 29th through June 1st.  Otherwise, I can make myself available whenever 
the drafting committee meets.

Thank you,

Stacey, 

I was in the MSN DSL pilot.  As you know MSN is no longer providing DSL 
through Northpoint.  You told me that Enron would not subsidize SWB DSL 
service which is what MSN suggested I sign up for.  What did Enron decide to 
do about DSL?  I could not tell from the ClickAtHome intranet.

Jennifer, 

What a cutie!  Meg is adorable and so grown up now!  She should start talking 
before long if she has not already.  I'm sure that you are teaching her to 
say Stacy.  I hope you guys are doing well.  I understand Mr Espey is not 
doing as well as hoped.  That must be particularly difficult for you guys 
since you are not near by.

When do you think that you will be in Houston again?  We miss you guys.  We 
got used to your being around last year.

Meredith is doing well.  She is starting to sit well on her own.  She still 
does an occasional face-plant though.  It really makes her mad when she 
does.  She loves her exersaucer.  We went to Arkansas for Easter so Meredith 
had her first plane ride.  She did very well.  I can't imagine entertaining a 
baby for five hours on a plane like you do!  Meredith has not mastered cereal 
yet.  We only feed her twice a week which does not help.  We keep joking that 
she will still be on formula when she goes to kindergarden!

I will send some picutures of Meredith soon.

Stacy

You are beginning to realize that time goes by awfully fast and we had better 
enjoy what we are doing while we are doing it.  You never get another chance

You are welcome to the car.  I will try to bring it tonight or better still 
can your Mom bring you over to get it tomorrow.  Either way is ok.

Doug:

Thank you for your e-mail updating us on the Ripley Campus Grand Opening 
events.    I have purchased a table at the Wednesday, April 11, HEART OF GOLD 
CELEBRATION  luncheon at the Wortham Center, and my wife and I will be 
attending.

However, I am unable to attend any of the other events due to my busy work 
schedule.

Tell Angela I look forward to seeing her at the HEART OF GOLD CELEBRATION  
luncheon on the 11th.

Thanks,
Stan Horton

Good morning.  Thanks for the yahoo greeting.  It made my day.  Have a great 
day.  Remember that Cathy and Carol's birthday is Nov. 30th.  I sent them a 
card and a $100 check to go out to dinner on us.  I signed it from all of 
us.  Hope you don't mind.  

They would enjoy an email from you.

In reviewing the key items of your business review with Jeff Skilling, he had 
some issues with your new Broadband business.  Please provide me with some 
more detail as follows:

It was mentioned that we had spent around $13 million thus far on dark 
fiber.  How much of the resultant capacity has been sold?  Are we laying the 
dark fiber at risk?  In other words are we taking a long position in dark 
fiber.  What is our capacity situation today?

Do you have a business plan for this new venture..ie what is the anticipated 
capital expenditures annually for this venture.  Who are the customers?  What 
is the expected return?  What is the payback on our investment, etc.

Who approved the formation of this new venture and the capital commitment?

Anything else that will help me get a clear understanding of what we have and 
where we are going with it.

Thank you for a very successful holiday party.  Debbie and I thoroughly

I would like to host a lunch for the committee, after the holidays, as a way 
of thanking you.   I will have Cindy coordinate your schedules.

Thanks again,

Q2 earnings report looks very good!  Congratulations.  I will keep it quiet 
until you are sure of the numbers. We should let Causey and Hayslett know for 
planning purposes ASAP. 

Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even 
worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?

Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?

Have a good week.  Thanks.

FYI....we have added Dan Dienstbier to the Northern Border Partners' Audit 
Committee.

SEC rules dictated that we add another member, and Dan Whitty and Gerald 
Smith wanted someone with an operations background.

Dan also serves on Dynegy's Board, but neither Bill Cordes (President of 
Northern Border) nor I saw a conflict.

Shelley, we need to make sure Mike knows of all the ramifications of this 
entire deal.  I have no problem with them pursuing a regulatory approach to 
the quality issue but a commercial decision would be better for all parties.

I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position 
Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via 
telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is 
being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early 
next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.

Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No 
one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.  
Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one 
of Lohitt's strong skills,

I will do whatever I can.  Joe is a real good person.  Besides I think you 
could become a very good regulatory analyst for us and Joe would be a 
wonderful teacher.  I hope everything works out for you  personally and 
professionally.

Since we are in the process of trying to exit this business the answer from 
Enron Wind would be no.  You might want to contact Condy Plson to see if the 
idea has any value to Enron.

I will leave Houston around 10:30 tomorrow, so lunch should be around 1:30.  
Then I am free for at least a couple of hours before I have to go to the 
Hyatt.  I will leave SA on Friday at noon if you want a ride home or if you 
want me to follow you.  I think however you leave earlier than that and thats 
ok.  I will be tied up the rest of the time there.

I am at EOTT this morning.  Glad we early voted.  I think Bush has it and I 
don't think it will be that close.  Watch how Florida and Pennslylvania go.  
If they go Bush; its over.  If Gore wins these two states he has a chance if 
he takes Michigan.  Key states are Florida, Pennslylvania,and Michigan.

I am still hoping for a last minute Nader rally.  

Sorry you don't feel well especially since this your your long day.  Good 
luck on your test.  I will be at the Rockets game tonight with tthe guys.

Email later this afternoon.

Love, Dad

Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou 
would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus 
should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all 
of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.

I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.

With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention 
bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave 
before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place 
that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should 
we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently 
offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA 
assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those 
positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual 
agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced 
severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford 
and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for 
him.

I will talk with you when you return.

Thanks.

Glad you finally made it!  Good luck on your Legal exam today.  Get some rest 
and start studying for Wednesday and Thursday exams.  The finish is close at 
hand.

Enjoyed taking you last night.  I like the time alone with you.  Saturday, I 
have a haircut at 2:30 so we can start shopping at 3 or go early and be done 
by noon.  Let me know and send me your Mother's list!

Thanks for the update.  Going to one of the power desks was a good move.  
Experience on the desk will prove very valuable in the years ahead.  I hope

Please just call Cindy Stark to get on my calendar.  I would warn you that I 
cannot see expending money for such a book since I do not see any value that 
would be added.  It would be nice to have but I was turning down painting 
projects on our pipeline that were in the $10k range during oour budget cycle!

After giving it some thought I think just naming Debbie as executor and agent

The Red Rock expansion needs to get  approval at the May 1st Board meeting.  
The procedure is to submit it to the Finance Committee of the Board for 
approval . Assuming the Finance Committee approves the project they would 
recommend it to the Board for approval.  By this memo, I am requesting that 
Rod coordinate with Rick Buy to get it on the Finance Committee agenda.

I will be in town for both the Board meeting and the Finance Committee 
meetings.  If formal presentations are required at the Finance Committee we 
can decide who should do them.  It is my understanding that no presentation 
needs to be done at the Board meeting.  I will check with Jeff to see if he 
wants a formal presentation to the Finance Committee or if he will do it 
himself.

That is not the issue.  By putting us in the middle between GTB and Solar we 
would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo 
if the unit does not function properly.  The whole deal gets complicated 
since there is a design engineer. oerator and equipment manufacturer and we 
get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner.  If the unit 
does operate properly, everyone will point fingers at everyone else,  I have 
seen this happen coutless times on EE&CC projects.  Why do I want to take 
this risk on an international project that according to Jerry's own numbers 
gets me about $800,ooo in current perios earnings and another $400'ooo 
deferred over many years.  It just is not worth the time and risk for that 
kind of money.  I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also.

Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto  (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan 
under the following  conditions.

1 -  Volumes will not fall.  In fact they will increase.

2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then 
East Power will have no Emmisions Positions,

3 -  Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.

4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer 
pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not 
keeping.

Give me a call if there are any issues.

It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of 
power in Ontario.  

1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to 
understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including 
building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the 
Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the 
Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for 
Ontario.  

2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto 
office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could 
always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.

3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have 
no power trading responsibilities.

4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use 
Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, 
however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.

5.  Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know 
the people and the technical resources available to him.

If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.

John

Book this deal very conservatively.  ie.  set the curve so you pay credit

men only club for free (except for caddie fees).  I figure the downside is 
that we get pummled and left for dead.  I'll let you know.

Can we put something into our trading system where it would stop us from 
entering a counterparty in if we were full on credit.  This could help the 
communication problem that currently exists on companies like Perry Gas.

I am working with CIBC on another credit mitigation deal.  They are 
interested but they have said nothing yet on pricing levels.  I am sending 
them something on Monday that will propose a Enron payment on Friday December 
17th of approximately $16 MM CAD.   Again, this payment would come from the 
U.S. office so if there are any administrative things that need to get done I 
suggest we get on it quickly.  I assume Juanita needs to deal with funding 
and Louie needs to secure a letter from CIBC re credit mitigation.  I'm in 
Houston part of the week but you can track me done through my secretary.  

Regards

Can you type up thank you letters for me.


Dear xxxx

I would like to thank you for your generous donation to The Order of Good 
Cheer fundraising effort.  Our organization raised over $200,000 for the 
Enviros Program.  The money was much needed and will allow this wonderful 
program to continue to improve the lives of young Calgarians who have 
experienced hardship.

Yours Truly

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five.

Now that we sent the first blow, lets get everyone together to discuss our 
future steps.  Next week is a nighmare but perhaps you could set  up a 
conference call sometime Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.  

Also, did Blakes definately drop us on this file or have they reconsidered.

I agree with all your points.  There had to be a first time.

The PPA auction is going along well I think.  We are leading on Sundance B 
and have been for 3 rounds now.  Some weird things are occuring so it is too 
early to tell what will utimately happen.  The government has said that it 
will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning.  We 
would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on Sundance B.  
Currently we are bid  $112,000,000 Canadian and a swap price of 33.5 CAD.  
But again its too early to get our hopes up.

All of a sudden Mark Frevert asks me everyday about when we'll know about 
hedging re PPA's and if we can delay the auction 2 weeks.

The dream is still alive.  

Let's see my boys come through.

Jan-

I checked the website for the hotels at Foz.  The tourism website is down.  
It looks like  a great place.  I'll have to convince Renato to go (you know, 
he might miss out on working out for one day).  I think the kids might like 
it too.  Did Alexia and Sebastien like it or was it too much walking?  I 
asked my boss about it.  He went with his family when he was living in 
Argentina.  They really enjoyed it.  Can you go ahead and check on flights 
and which hotel to stay at?  The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the 
nicer one on the internet.  I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking 
them there.  Is that right?  Let me know the airline and I'll check here.  I 
guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.  Also, would y'all want to 
go as well?

Thanks for your help.

Susan

Thanks for the email.  Kali was not able to make last Sunday's game due to a 
schedule conflict that I had.  Plus, she will not go to the last game because 
her best friend's birthday party is at the same time.  I had her skip another 
friend's party to make the one game she did participate in (all the softball 
girls schedule their parties on Sunday so as not to conflict with those 
games!!).  If it's not too late, do not order a trophy for her.  She really 
was never much of a team participant.  I'm hoping her enthusiasm this fall 
will be like last fall and not this spring.  Thanks for all your help, time 
and effort.

Susan Pereira

P.S.-
Do you know who some of the U10 girls coaches will be??  Will you be 
coaching?  I did not sign up to coach because I may asst. coach my son's U6

I got your message.  Kali has been going to the Thursday practices, with the 
exception of the last three weeks due to rainout, spring break and a going 
away party for a friend.  She'll be there on this Thursday.  Do you have a 
uniform for her?  Maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt 
and has that for the next game.  I'll try to work on her.

Thanks,

Hi, Jan!  I don't know if you'll get this, but Maman said your email was back 
in business (my words, not hers!).  I asked the kids about going ahead to 
Brazil with y'all.  Michael will do whatever; Kali was a little hesitant.  
When do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave.  
We'll need to coordinate the travel schedules.  We're going to use OnePass 
miles for at least two tickets, so we'll need to finalize things in early 
April to get seats.

Talk to you soon.

Susan

Sugarbaker yet?  I would be happy(?) to talk with her, so please feel free to 
forward my email address to her.  If I don't hear back from you today, I will 
probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.  Maybe I can clarify a few 
issues with her.  As for Cindy Colvin's "presentation," I've spoken with 
Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.  In 
the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.  

Let me know what responses you receive today on the RFP.  I know we will need 
to schedule a committee meeting in the next week or so.

Thanks,

There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like 
to see on the website and stack manager.  I realize that there may be bigger 
issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey 
Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??  
For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack 
manager.  Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the 
website, so people could shade products different colors.  This might cut 
down on trades made in error.

Thanks,

We will not be settling the El Paso/Stingray imbalance.  El Paso insists on 
being paid back in kind, as opposed to cashing out at prices when the 
imbalance occurred.  We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.  Maybe 
we'll pay it back next year.

Ruth-

I've been trying to call you back since last night, but your line is always 
busy.  I'd be happy to drive on Saturday.  Shall I call everyone?  Other than 
Jazz and Kali, I'll need to pick up Francie, Angela and Amy, right?  Any more?

Thanks,

Susan

Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents 
last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in 
transit!!).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the 
thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set in 
a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.

Susan

P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.

Hi, Jan!  I hope you are all doing well.  I'm sorry to hear that your mother 
is ill.  I'm sure it's frustrating to be so far away.  

I know you have other things on your mind right now, but I wanted to check 
with you about our visiting this summer.  We were thinking about the second 
week in July.  We have not made any definitive plans.  Let me know if that 
will work.  If this summer doesn't work, we can always try next summer...

Take care.

Susan

Ruth-

I went ahead and scheduled Kali to do the GSWEC camp the first two sessions.  
I've only put the deposit down, so I can get that money back if we decide to 
do the Blue Fox Farm camp instead.  Hopefully, we'll have that info the first 
week in May.  Marla is planning on signing up Blakely for the second session 
there, pending what the Blue Fox Farm schedule looks like.  I think Anna 
Edelman is also interested.  I left a message with Sue today letting her know 
that I was reserving a spot for Kali at GSWEC just in case the Blue Fox Farm 
doesn't work.

Thanks,

Susan

We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way:

We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50.
Koch owes us 13,639 mmbtu at $2.21/mmbtu and 11,720 mmbtu at $2.38/mmbtu, 
which equals $58,035.79.
The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I negotiated this with Scott Garrison 
at Koch.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car 
trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and 
including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 
additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few 
weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school 
during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Hi, Jan.  I hope you are all doing well.  Maman has updated us on your 
mother's condition.  I know it must be stressful, especially from long 
distance.  Kali liked her birthday gifts.  Believe it or not, we didn't 
already have the World Pup movie. We had rented it back in February and the 
kids liked it.

I'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation, but I was 
wondering what your travel schedule was in June.  When will you be arriving, 
when will you be returning (Kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling 
without us on the plane), etc.  The earliest we could leave for Brazil would 
be the evening of Friday, July 6.  We would probably need to return to 
Houston by July 14.  Let me know how that sounds.  Also, if we need to 
reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother, 
let me know.  That's certainly more important.

Talk to you soon.....

Susan

I don't think we will be able to do group lessons during the week, but, just 
for grins, what is the time of the Tuesday afternoon class?  How many kids 
are in the class and who is the instructor?  Also, are there any group 
lessons on the weekends that my daughter Kali might participate in?  Are the 
classes large?

Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement 
payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the 
Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement 
from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume 
statement.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to help you sort recognitions during the 
day on Tuesday -- I can't get off work on that day.  If you are able to sort 
our troop's recognitions (troop 12357) by Tuesday evening, I would love to 
come by and pick them up.  Our last Brownie meeting is on Wednesday 
afternoon, and I wanted to get everything to our troop leader Wednesday 
morning before work.  Let me know what time would be convenient for me to 
come by.  I have a Southside Place city council meeting to attend at 7 pm but 
could come by before.....

Ok, here's the plan.....

Kali and Michael will leave for Brazil with y'all on Wed. the 27th on the 
evening flight (?).  Let me know the exact Continental flight number so we 
can make the reservations.  We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later 
I guess.

Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, 
arriving Saturday morning.   The four of us will return to Houston on the 
next Fri. night flight (13th).  I think we've decided not to go to Foz do 
Iguacu, since we have so little time.  Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a 
few days.  Can we all go together and drive.  Maybe you could get hotel 
reservations there?

Let me know what you think.   We're excited about the trip.  The kids can't 
wait.

Will the last brownie meeting be on the afternoon of May 9?  We have early

available until the evening of the 9th.  I've emailed the coordinator to see 
if we can get them earlier.

Dear Mr. Junek-

Per Scott Goodell's advice, I am officially informing you that the CES 
offshore firm contract is now on your book.  Scott thinks that it is 
volumetric, so there should be no impact on you.  The wellhead desk will take 
this over as soon as their pools are set up on Col. Gulf.

Sincerely yours,

If I want to communicate with the other commission members, am I supposed to 
funnel it through you?  If so, I want to find out if anyone is interested in 
setting up a table at the carnival (April 21) to solicit public opinion on 
P&Z issues.  We could set up next to the tree committtee or share a table.  
I'll be at the carnival until about 3 pm; however, I'll be working from 
12-2.  Also, we could solicit public opinion outside the clubhouse on 
election day, May 5.  I could do that anytime before 4 pm.  Anyone else 
interested???

Amy,
 
Hi.  This is Richard's, and now Erin's, friend Clint.  I know that she spoke 
with you about me, and I wanted to see if you might be interested in getting 
together sometime.  You probably want to know a little about me.  I work at 
Enron as an electricity trader, and I've lived in Houston for about three 
years.  I've known Richard 9 years from our fraternity days together.  I'm 27 
and I graduated from UT 4 1/2 years ago.  Of course, I would be interested in 
hearing something about you as well. Erin just told me that she had a good 
friend in Houston that she thought I should meet.  Let me know what you 
think, and we can go from there.

Clint

Yes, I'll be in Houston this week.  We could discuss there. But might be 
useful to discuss tomorrow when you return.  I'm available.  Seems useful to 
try to get a start on it tomorrow.  You available for a quick call?  My 
schedule's pretty flexible.

Hey folks.  Mr. Jackson makes some very good points, which I'd like to 
include.  However, before I work them in, wanns make sure that everyone 
agrees with his comments, since including some of his will require some 
modifications to the direction that the memo takes.  We could discuss in a 
brief conference call if folks wish.  Also, please review what I've done--not 
major edits, but edits (with some questions and additions) nonetheless.

Best,
Jeff

Please note Maviglio's comments in response to Sec of State Bill Jones' claim 
that Davis' consultants have violated ethics laws by not filing conflict of 
interest reports with the state while working for Davis.  Maviglio sez:

Jones is "on a witch hunt on something outside his jurisdiction." 
Mark, quit feeding PR lines to Davis' people.

Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt 
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief
Thursday, May 31, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/31/M
N231235.DTL 
Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern 
California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at 
the expense of its biggest customers. 
The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial 
customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion 
back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users 
would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. 
Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but 
supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and 
should shoulder the costs it created. 
"We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these 
problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any 
problems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). 
Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put 
Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help 
restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. 
Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP 
lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. 
The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and 
"noncore" users. 
SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS
Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core 
users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would 
be those using more than 500 kilowatts. 
Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. 
But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. 
Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- 
term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar 
panels, on contract with the utility. 
That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of 
the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of 
electricity. 
Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to 
buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to 
make themselves energy self-sufficient. 
The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy 
customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. 
During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users 
would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would 
shift exclusively to the big users. 
Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be 
given what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate 
cheaper rates. 
Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users 
because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. 
Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. 
EDISON 'ENCOURAGED'
Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out 
details of the plan. 
A spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks. 
"I haven't seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice 
president with Edison. "They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and 
trying to find a solution." 
Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there 
is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. 
"We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will 
experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J. Smith, a 
lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. 
"When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another 
potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," 
Smith said. 
Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association: "What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying 
the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. 
They don't want voters to pay because they vote." 
CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business 
interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto 
residential and smaller commercial customers. 
"I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public 
Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big 
business end up costing more for residential and small businesses," 
Rosenfield said. 
The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of 
the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. 
Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that 
for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. 
Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state 
purchase of transmission lines. 
In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the 
transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. 
In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to 
either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, 
for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

David:
Thanks so much.  I'd almost given up hope.  I will be distributing the 
proposal immediately and attempting to garner support industry-wide, across 
the nation.  Can't make any promises of support, but will be working hard to 
try to bring people together.  I'll be in touch soon.  Don't hesitate to 
contact me to discuss it further.  415.782.7822.

The Commission closed the hearings last night at 7 PM.
The Commission refused all attempts by the utilities'--and there were 
several--to get information on "ending the rate freeze" into the hearing 
record.
The Commission is attempting to get a draft decision out at 10 AM today (PST).
If it gets out, there will be oral argument at 12:30 today (PST), with final 
decision issued tomorrow at the Commission's regularly scheduled business 
meeting.
If it does not get out, there will be no oral argument, and the Commission 
will issue its final decision tomorrow at its regularly scheduled business 
meeting.
Anything could happen but it appears at this point that the decision will 
only address the need for a rate increase (rumors flyling furiously regarding 
how high the increase will be), with "rate freeze" issues put off for another 
day in the near future.
Yesterday, the Governor of California joined Edison's suit against FERC 
calling for region-wide, hard price caps.

Copy of order to follow.  Here's a quick summary.  Does not look great for 
the utilities.  More to follow.

one cent/kwh charge for all customers--equals 9% for rez, 7% for small biz, 
12% for med commercial, 15% for large commercial and industrial
only in place for 90 days
Adopts TURN proposal for netting undercollection (from rate freeze) against 
overcollection (for CTC)
Hearings begin next Wednesday (01.10.01) to begin address all remaining 
issues (including whether rate freeze has ended and when) and to set up a 
timetable to examine the results of the auditor's report

On the 21st, Tauzin and Barton are holding separate meetings with executives 
from the respective stakeholder groups in Southern California to have "frank" 
discussions about California.  Steve Kean will attend for Enron.  At Steve's 
meetings will be other gas and electric marketers, and generators.  Linda 
Robertson would like to talk with us tomorrow about getting Steve prep-ed for 
the meeting.  She'd like to have the call at 3 PM California time.  Her 
assistant will be sending details very soon.

Ok.  Here they are.  On exhibit A, I didn't touch numbers are exhibit #s.  
Also, I deleted CAPM, since we ain't got anything yet.  And I deleted the 
part that said "ticket sales taxes don't matter much," because now that we 
have the numbers they could matter, cuz it's really tight between bond 
payments and tax revs.  Anyway, that's it.  I checked and doubled checked the 
numbers and exihibit #s in the exec sum, but you may want to give one last 
peek.  Thanks SO much for pulling it together.

Jeff

Let's discuss further.  I've been in close contact with Chris on this.  I'm 
not sure that we necessarily need a "presentation" on the issue.  Speaking 
only for California, policy makers and industry participants know a) that 
there's a problem and b) that the magnitude of the problem is significant, 
and there's not a heckuvalot of leg work that needs to be done on that 
front.  I would suggest that we continue to work on analysis internally, and 
spend some time discussing further the extent to which we need a presentation 
for external consumption.  As everyone's aware, this issue is a very 
complicated one and sensitive one for Enron and we need to be very careful 
w.r.t. how we approach it.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

lower.  It's slipping thru Davis' fingers.  Jeff

understatement.  Couple thoughts...I'm pretty sure that Seab has done 
extensive analysis on the UK and he'd likely therefore be very useful in 
developing rebuttal. (Though very close to it at one point, I've been removed 
for a few years.)  Also, Schroeder and his gang could also likely shed some 
insights, and seems that Schroeder's pretty close now with Littlechild---that 
might be another avenue for information to rebut.

Looks like Loretta's attempt to peel off the DWR contracts from the bonds at 
the PUC, which the Legislature has been contemplating but hasn't done 
anything about.

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

********************************************

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL 
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern 
California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an 
alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an 
uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of 
Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's 
transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 
billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in 
debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained 
frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last 
night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of 
mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation 
haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk 
before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and 
Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, 
but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to 
iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that 
could be accomplished in the next few days. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house." 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats 
and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
"The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This 
particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being 
cannibalized." 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not 
cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, 
which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since 
January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman 
Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to 
garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the 
Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
"It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say 
I'm tentatively satisfied." 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former 
state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 
legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
"As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
deadline, too much gets done." 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight 
bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Dan Walters: Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality continues


(Published July 11, 2001) 
California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis, to wit: 
The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it 
can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of 
dollars to cover the debt. 
There is a strong possibility, perhaps a probability, that when summer's heat 
truly descends, there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners 
demand more juice than California can generate or buy. 
One major utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has filed for bankruptcy 
protection and a second, Southern California Edison, is on the brink of 
joining it. 
There is, however, a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin, 
media leaks and made-for-television buzz words -- and it is rapidly becoming 
dominant, while the real situation fades into the background. 
This week's comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality 
and everything to do with the virtual version. 
Gov. Gray Davis and other officials demanded $8.9 billion in refunds from the 
generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past 
year, alleging that California is, in Davis' words, "being gouged and ripped 
off." But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an 
arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intended 
for a refund proceeding. And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealistic, 
Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity. 
"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a 
billion dollars," Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed. But 
that's a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due. "If you 
think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see 
you in court," Davis said Tuesday. 
Why is Davis being so belligerent? Because it's good politics. Ever since he 
began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off 
California, Davis' approval ratings have been climbing. If he settled for 
substantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple 
of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be 
embarrassed. Politically, he's served by continuing to portray himself as 
fighting for California and against the out-of-state generators. 
That it's more political construct than reality is indicated by another event 
this week, Davis' release of state power purchase data from early in the year 
-- numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do 
it. 
Davis and his minions have been accusing Texas-based generators and power 
brokers of particularly egregious price gouging -- clearly playing on 
Californians' instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texan 
George W. Bush is a co-conspirator. But the power purchase records -- which 
were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee -- indicate that 
less than 10 percent of California's power purchase dollars were going to 
Texas and the private sellers, in general, charged the state less than such 
publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that 
undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not, however, deterring Davis from 
continuing to operate, at least for public consumption, in the melodramatic 
virtual world. 
One cannot, however, ignore reality forever. The likelihood of a 
pro-generator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for 
Davis, or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from 
slipping into bankruptcy court. The Legislature has refused to act on the 
Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility's 
debts would be slimmed down by FERC. 
This week's farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will 
stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the 
utility into bankruptcy court later this summer. That's part of that nasty 
old reality that cannot simply be wished away.

If Ken Lay's going to Sac to have meetings, seems that he should meet 
w/Burton.  You agree?  Thx, Jeff

On Friday, I attended a meeting with Ken Lay and Karen Denne that Mike Peev=
ey=20
and David Freeman requested.  Mike Peevey was President of Southern=20
California Edison before founding NEV (which he eventually sold to AES). =
=20
Freeman is General Manager of LADWP. =20

The Governor hired Peevey to be his chief energy advisor.  Freeman is the=
=20
Governor=01,s chief negotiator responsible for signing power contracts on b=
ehalf=20
of DWR now that the Legislature has passed AB1X and the Governor has signed=
=20
it.  John Burton, the leader of the State Senate, is responsible for gettin=
g=20
the Freeman the job of chief negotiator, but Peevey was clearly in charge. =
=20

Also at the meeting was Vikram Budraja, former SVP of power systems and=20
planning for Edison.  He=01,s now a private consultant that Freeman hired t=
o=20
help him with the contract negotiations.

Peevey asked for the meeting to urge Enron to respond to DWR=01,s RFP issue=
d on=20
Friday.  Peevey/Freeman want to announce a package of deals on Tuesday.  Th=
ey=20
implied that they=01,ve already got some deals done and expect to have 8+ d=
eals=20
to announce on Tuesday, though they gave no details other than to say that=
=20
they=01,ve got a deal with Calpine (as reported in the press).  Their plan =
is to=20
announce on Tuesday the names of the suppliers they=01,ve signed with, the =
total=20
number of megawatts signed, and the average price per MW.  They are concern=
ed=20
that the media will want them to make public the details of each individual=
=20
deal, which for obvious reasons they don=01,t want to do.

Peevey and Freeman also said that they don=01,t want to sign too many long-=
term=20
contracts though they recognize that there=01,s a trade-off between term an=
d=20
price.

Ken Lay told them that Enron would respond.  ENA is preparing a response.  =
He=20
also told them that EES was working on a plan to reduce demand at our=20
customers=01, facilities and that the plan would be completed and ready for=
=20
implementation very soon.

I=01,ve summarized the points that Ken Lay made and the responses from Peev=
ey=20
and Freeman:

It would be difficult to enter into contracts without some assurance that D=
WR=20
is creditworthy.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
AB1X provides DWR the funds necessary=01*beginning on Friday, Feb 1st=01*to=
=20
purchase the power necessary to fill the utilities=01, short position.  Ken=
 Lay=20
pressed them on this point and Peevey insisted that AB1X provides the funds=
=20
needed to pay suppliers.

The RFP should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposa=
ls.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
Be as creative as possible.  All offers will be considered (despite the=20
language contained in the RFP).

The only customers who have been protected from California=01,s failed=20
restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under Direct=20
Access.  In addition, one of the quickest ways to help solve California=01,=
s=20
shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site=20
generation.  Taking away Direct Access and access to customers generally=01=
*as=20
AB1X does=01*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed.

Response from Peevey:
He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill.  He=
=20
affirmed what we already know=01*that the head of the Senate oversight comm=
ittee=01*
Debra Bowen=01*is working on a =01&clean-up=018 bill to remove the prohibit=
ion.  In=20
response to Ken Lay=01,s points that California needed to make sure that ut=
ility=20
interconnection and stand-by rates didn=01,t continue to impede on-site=20
generation, Peevey and Freeman said that the Governor understood the proble=
m=20
and was prepared to fix it.

Siting laws have got to be streamlined and California (i.e., the Governor)=
=20
has got to credibly commit to the swift development of new power plants in=
=20
order to push the forward curve down.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
The Governor is scheduled to offer a plan this week that is targeted at=20
expediting siting and development.

DWR should accept demand reduction bids at the same time that it accepts=20
supply-side bids.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
They agreed but said that there is extreme political pressure to announce t=
he=20
signing of some supply deals on Tuesday in order to prove to legislators th=
at=20
DWR will be able to keep the lights on, and at a =01&reasonable=018 price. =
 They=20
also need to sign some deals in light of the fact that the feds are very=20
unlikely to extend the DOE order forcing suppliers to sell to the IOUs.  On=
ce=20
they=01,ve shown that they can manage the supply side, Peevey and Freeman s=
aid=20
they want to quickly turn their attention to demand-side bidding.

These are the highlights.  I=01,d be happy to give more details on the Mond=

Check  it out.  It's a pretty darned smart letter:  1) very cooperative 2)

The meeting between Skilling & the Governor went well.  He's intrigued about 
the notion of doing an auction for power over the internet.  Governor and his 
folks are going to do some internal work this week and there's going to be 
another call next Monday.  Will fill you in as things progress.  Thanks again 
for the pricing sheet.  Please keep all of this highly confidential.

Speaking of cheese, I spoke with Jeff Green last night, and under the 
circumstances, he'd prefer to do the Dome road next summer (when he's up 
doing more work on my property.  I agreed (there's a lot more bark from all 
the wood chopping and that'll get us through till June).  I talked to him 
about the culvert.  He had some thoughts, which I'll pass along and I'll talk 
to him about it some more this weekend.

Just checking in to see if anything that you folks were working on ever got 
into the S.D. Tribune, etc., or if you were continuing to work on things?

Hope all's well.  It's a jungle out there.

If there is going to be a play come the first of the year to meld 
California's PX and ISO, Skilling may want to consider pre-empting that 
agenda (and most of this is not new; already included in previous messaging 
points we've developed internally):

It's the gas industry, stupid---for profit transcos is the answer.
California's big mistake was replacing one monopoly--the utility---with 
another--the PX.  PX's are not necessarily bad things.  But PXs with a 
monopoly is a very bad thing.
Forcing the IOUS to buy everything from the PX was irresponsible.
"Put everyone on a variable rate mortgage" story.
Decision makers openly admitted that they put in place a strucuture designed 
NOT to encourage retail choice and competition.
Decision makers actively urged families and businesses NOT to switch to 
providers offering an "insurance policy" (i.e., fixed price deals) against 
the volatile and risky power exchange price.
When you combine the supply shortage, the PX monopoly, the nonexistant retail 
market and decision makers' attempts to discourage choice, you get a 
debacle--that's what California set itself up for, and that's what it got.
Putting the PX inside the ISO will only infect the wound that's already been 
inflicted.
The real answer is....(we've developed these points already).


This is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate, but 
wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Lee:

Looks great.  Could you do me a favor?  You have "generating company" rep on 
the agenda.  Enron does not see itself as a generating company.  In fact, the 
only generation that we own in California is 50+ MWs of wind power in 
Southern California.  Could you change it to "energy service provider" rep?  
Hope that's not a problem.

Best,
Jeff

Here's my cut at #3.  I haven't had the benefit of Kim's answer, but made 
some assumptions and took a shot.  Likely to doctor it up a bit, but wanted 
to find out if folks are in agreement or if you think I've lost my mind.  Let 
me know.  #3 is somewhat at the heart of the questions, so I want to make 
sure that I get your feedback.  And my apologies for not having gotten you 
something sooner.  Be on the look out, there is a cold going around that 
really kicked my butt over the last week.

In the Senate:
Today the Senate passed out of committee SB18XX and is expected to pass the 
bill out of the full Senate sometime today.  
The bill would de-link 1) payment for bonds issued to repay General Fund 
dollars used to buy power from 2) payment for power contracts signed by DWR.
The Senate has thus far failed to get its version of the "Edison MOU" 
(SB78XX) out the necessary committees in order to get it to the floor for a 
vote by the full Senate.  
It is unclear at this point whether the Senate will try to vote the MOU bill 
out of the Senate, or focus solely on SB18XX (de-linking bonds from DWR 
contracts) prior to leaving for vacation.
Dunn got a resolution passed that permits his investigative committee to take 
depositions of individuals.

In the Assembly:
The Assembly has thus far failed to get an "MOU" (82XX or 83XX) voted out of 
the full Assembly, though expectations are that the Hertzberg bill (82XX) 
will get voted out of the Assembly today.

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants 
has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 31, 2001) 
California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power 
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say. 
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a 
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between 
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state. 
"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't 
seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on 
the governing board of the Independent System Operator. 
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a 
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in 
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers. 
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped 
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some 
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't. 
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of 
the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR. 
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves 
confidential bidding behavior. 
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the 
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his 
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined. 
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose 
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said. 
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's 
not necessarily a good fit." 
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines. 
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing 
output when demand doesn't match forecasts. 
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a 
process the industry calls "decking." 
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly 
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the 
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20 
a megawatt-hour. 
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660 
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the 
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee. 
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one plant 
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of 
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said. 
The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarming 
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less 
than it paid, he said. 
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business 
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather. 
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for 
no good reason," Florio said. 
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas 
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because 
they're contracted with DWR," he said. 
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also 
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said. 
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on 
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO 
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting 
costs, Florio said. 
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical 
decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie 
McCorkle. 
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on 
bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a 
smoother-running system in place by next summer.

These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some 
specifics for the last few months.     A short discussion with Phil might 
lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on 
Dave.     What are your thoughts?

Andre,

Here is a short subset of 10-minute records containing the extreme 
temperature event (approximately 3 hours of before/after data). The turbine 
was #105 at Desert Sky on May 1st. Times are in UTC. The values are 10-minute 
averages.

If you have additional questions let me know.

Tom,

Here is a sample of the output for this request. For this I have only used 
May 2002. I for the boxplots one has had records removed when the ambient and 
gearbox temp is less than 0 (I can provide turbines and times if needed). 
There were many records where this occured. There were also 5 records where 
the Gearbox temp was over 100 and these were also removed. All of these over 
100 records occured on turbine 105 on May 1st between 1640 and 1740 (UTC). 
Temperatures were as high as 366. 

If this format is acceptable let me know and I will generate graphs for the 
data we have (Jan - "current" 2002).

Tom,

Here are the new graphs with totals (bar charts) and distributions (boxplots) 
for all seven sites through May 2002. 

I believe that I have come up with a method of providing you with the 
ESTIMATED energy lost. Since it requires using two data sets (faults and 
10-minute data) it will be take a bit longer to run. However I hope to have 
that result to you next week.

Joe,

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is "Energy curtailed" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message "Turbine Com Established" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a "Energy 
curtailed" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded? 

Thanks,
Mark

From the stage I was at on the duration and energy it was just as easy to do 
all 7 sites as the 3 you specifically requested. If you do not want the 
additional graphs let me know and I'll pull them out of the Acrobat file.

Jeff,

Mar - May 2002 have been recalculated and spreadsheets created. Mar & Apr 
wend down slightly due to the "extra" turbines. May has gone up, possibly due 
to some data filling in holes from before, data recovery does appear to be 
better this time. The spreadsheets are sorted and totaled by Bus.ID. The 
"extras" are at the bottom with 0 production.

Tom,

The graphs attached are formatted the same as the sample set I sent you 
earlier. As of today, Desert Sky 10-minute data has not been uploaded for 
June 2002 yet, and the data for Jan is nonexistant, so the graphs go from Feb 
to May 2002. 

If you have questions or comments let me know.

Tom,

Attached are the graphs for energy lost due to the pitch and overspeed faults 
you listed. As I mentioned before the methodology requires decent data 
recovery for the 10-minute data. The data recovery was poor for several sites 
in January, and for Fenner and Klondike in May. 

I will be compiling a report on this request, summarizing the graph types and 
some explanation of the methods used to produce them. I hope to have that 
completed within the next couple of days.

If you see deficiencies or suggested modifications let me know.

Mark

Tom, 

Here are the fault paretos of fault counts for all sites for May 2002 
(may2002paretos_faults.pdf). For readability only the top 30 faults for each 
site are displayed. Both Texas sites had VERY high numbers of "wind 
deviation" faults.

I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto 
(by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf), 
which shows that the Texas sites have the highest mean faults per turbine. 
This also has boxplots of the number of faults by site to show the outliers.

I will do the June data, if still desired, when the data upload is completed.

As always, if you have questions or comments let me know.

Mark

Maybe I mis-interpreted again, but here are the graphs for site total (the 
boxplots are still by turbine). This is for May. I will wait to see if this

Tom,

I have energy estimates for May 2002 attached. Graph 1 is site totals, graph 
2 is (total lost)/(total actual production) where total actual production is 
taken from the kWh reported in the owner report, and graph 3 is the by 
turbine distribution (using box plots) of energy lost. 

The energy lost estimation method I employed is susceptible to problems with 
data recovery (10-minute data), which in May 2002 was especially poor at 
Klondike and Fenner, so those number are not as informative as those for the 
other sites. 

If these graphs provide you the information you need, I will continue with 
the remaining months (Jan - Apr). Otherwise let me know and we'll refine this 
process to get you what you need.

Mark

Tim,

In Oct 2001 I produced the attached reports for Michael Paine. I hope these

Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to 
provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral 
arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market. In that 
regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting 
different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury 
Notes and Treasury Bonds.  Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have 
the "choice" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations 
such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this 
option.  

LEGAL:  When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit 
requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of 
Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13. 

CREDIT:  When drafting credit worksheets, please be  specific when requesting 
types of Eligible Collateral other than cash.

We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of 
Eligible Collateral to Library Doc.

 "(c)  Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, 
in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate so long as the obligations of such 
Affiliate are guaranteed by Enron Corp. pursuant to a guaranty substantially

Mark:  Your name was provided to me by John Greene who is temporarily 
residing in Enron's U.K. office.  I am a lawyer in the Enron North America 
Corp. legal department.
I need to speak with someone regarding the London Instinet installation.
Two different Enron  companies (both U.S. corporations) already have Instinet 
agreements.  They are Enron North America Corp. and ECT Investments, Inc.  
The London installation would presumably be in the name of a DIFFERENT 
entity.  I need to understand in WHAT NAME the installation will proceed.  
Please help to fill in the details ASAP.  My number in Houston is 
713-853-5620.  I am this moment contacting David Terrace in London as I 
understand he handles all documentation.

(2)  credit trading (do we need anyone else?)

Either of Tuesday or Friday morning works fine.  Let me propose 9 am Tuesday 
for softs and 10 am for credit (and I am flexible).  Bob and I are located 
only several offices apart on the 38th floor of the Enron building.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Tanya:

After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following:

(1)  Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as "credit review".  Should this 
remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?

(2)  Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new "Forest Oil" of the 
list so I say let's forget it.  No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest 
draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.  Further, she 
cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.

Please let me know what you would like to do.

Darren:  Laurel mentioned that you were interested in existing/pending 
brokerage/futures agreements.  Attached are our most recent matrices by Enron 
company.  ALL of these agreements are negotiated by legal and must be 
executed by the business unit (VP or higher) and Ted Murphy.  Sheila Glover 
always sends a request and explanation for new account to legal, compliance 
and Ted Murphy.  Legal keeps a comprehensive listing by Enron company in an 
effort to avoid confusion.  Legal updates authorized trader lists and trading 
resolutions.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

forwarded to you on Wednesday.  

Are we agreed?  

Please let me know asap.  I know that the parties wanted to close today.

All:

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING BASED UPON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES TO THIS 
PREPAY

(1)  The Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement with ECT is a restricted 
master.  It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not 
necessarily market (or ENA) standard.  It should be reviewed immediately by 
legal and credit.

(2)  The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old.  IT IS 
NOT AN ISDA .  It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to 
simple transactions and commodities).  The terminology is not even ISDA 
terminology.  This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for 
upgrading to an ISDA.  

Rod:  You need to take a look at the Toronto Dominion (Texas) master 
agreement now and we should discuss.

Treasa:  Will there be a rate swap?  Under which master(s)?

I don't know if you have spoken with Susan Flynn about her schedule 
before/after her surgery, but I have some questions that you may have already 
addressed, such as:

Has Susan prepared a matrix reflecting the status of documentation (i.e., 
existing masters, agreements to use ENA master/terminate counterparty 
master,etc.) with the various CES counterparties?  Carol mentioned that she 
could finalize this project.

Will someone receive be checking Susan's email and voice mail and physical 
mail each day?

What efforts (if any) are ongoing with respect to PGE?

What about existing files?  Top Tens (Swiss Re)?  Any ISDA comparisons could 
be accelerated by giving directly to attorneys.

Who will prepare reports for legal/credit meeting?

Who is entering year-end deals onto Lotus Notes?  Should Susan Bailey handle 
per Carol's suggestion?

I'm sure that everyone in the group would appreciate a better understanding 
of how to handle the situation.  Thanks.  Sara

Carol:  I spoke with Richard Peterson (retail side).  Apparently we were 
dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.  We agreed to (1) 
mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been 
negotiated last year (with our form changes).  John Scales (exploration side) 
wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.  Do you want to handle?  Just

The east and west power desks are creating slightly different floating price 
language for some of the power pools.  The west desk wants "negative prices" 
to be averaged in as "zeroes"; the east desk wants to average in all prices 
"positive or negative".  I'm inclined to let the traders do as they wish.  I 
can't seem to get an explanation for the difference in approach (in each 
instance ENA may take either side of the deal).  The confirm desk will have 
to pay attention to the source of the confirms to use the correct pricing 
language.  I don't know if this will create an on-line trading issue.

What do you think?  Sara

Effective immediately, all questions from the confirmation desk to legal 
should be routed to a designated paralegal on a quarterly basis (with the 
exception of the very first rotation) as follows:

Susan Bailey - X34737  September 1, 1999 - December 31, 1999
Susan Flynn  -  X30975                    January 1, 2000       - March 31, 
2000
Marie Heard -  X33907                     April 1, 2000             - June 
30, 2000

You will be advised of subsequent rotations.  Please do NOT route calls to 
Tana Jones who will be spending most of her time working on special projects 
for our group.

This procedure should not affect any existing arrangements you may have with 
a particular attorney.

Please contact me if you have any questions.  Sara

Jarrod:  Attached is the price correction language.  There is a 60 day true 
up with a 30 day notification period after the correction is announced.  Upon 
notification by a party, there is a 3 Business Day period for payment.  This 
language tracks the ISDA so that our approach in each instance will be 
identical.  We will need to add "Calculation Agent" to the confirmation.  
Please call if you have any questions.  Sara

P.S.  you should use a paralegal for Annex B purposes and if the omnibus is

Hello there!  Hope all is well.  Will you be at the legal conference later 
this month?

Would you please provide us with information identifying the specific entity 
requiring the brokerage account and a brief description of the transaction 
for which the account is required.  Also, for purposes of your unanimous 
consent or resolution,  you should note that either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy 
should be one of the two signatories required for opening the account.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Sara

Bill:  I have previously discussed this issue with Rod.  I would like to 
revisit once again.  These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE 
stock.  There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools 
more frequently than in the past.  I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. 
securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely 
involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to 
Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, 
even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty 
capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each 
confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on 
behalf of Enron Corp.).

I would like to discuss ASAP as we are in the midst of negotiations with CSFB 
International, UBS AG, Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. and Lehman 
Brothers Finance S.A.

Mark, you may recall my memo to you in April, 1999 which indicated that for 
netting purposes, the conditions included:

1.  The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or 
occur on a French regulated market

2.  One of the parties must be (a) an "investment firm" within the meaning of 
the law of 2nd of July, 1996, (b) an instituion or firm benefitting from the 
provisions of article 25 of the Law or (c) a non-resident entity having a 
"comparable status"

The term "investment firm" embodies financial type institutions which recieve 
and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties.

There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France, 
insurance companies, broker types, etc.)  .For example, one murky designation 
includes "persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to 
their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do 
not prohibt the carrying on of investment services".  Slaughter and May has 
advised that they could assist us in determining whether our French 
counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with 
the counterparty (and extract a rep from them as well).  There are other 
categories as well.   I have a copy of the law if you would like to review.

The non-resident entity having "comparable status" is the category WE were 
trying for fit into without much success.

Tana tells me that I have given you misinformation.  Perhaps the law has 
changed and Justin has a recent update.  

ENA has a Soc Gen master, and we have recently sent a Deemed ISDA to a French 
corporate (one shot deal only).

Have you sent our form of guaranty since we're wasting time reviewing several 
different formats?  This should always be our first approach.  Also, you had 
best advise the company that we will not provide an unlimited guaranty

Peter:  I know that Gary Rosenblum is out of town until after Labor Day.  
Gary's voice mail directs callers to a gentleman with the last name of 
"McFarber" at Ext. 6128..  I left a voice mail for him this morning and have 
not heard back.  Is there a lawyer to whom I can direct questions about your 
form of equity forward?  Thanks very much.  Sara (713/853-5620)

Please see the attachment for a specific definition of ELIGIBLE SWAP 
PARTICIPANT and the TRADE OPTION EXEMPTION.

From a legal perspective and to avoid scrutiny and regulation by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ENA must always comply with the Trade 
Option Exemption when entering into options (as buyer or seller) with a third 
party.  Some of ENA's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from 
regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying 
commodity (such as banks, hedge funds, etc) even though they may be entering 
into the transaction for business purposes.  If that situation occurs, ENA 
MUST ALWAYS BE THE OFFEREE OF THE OPTION (as buyer or seller) and ENA cannot 
solicit the party to enter into the transaction.

If ENA's trading partner fails to satisfy the Trade Option Exemption, our 
confirmation will EXPLICITLY state that ENA was offered the option to buy or 
sell by the counterparty.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara [ENA legal]

Just got your voice mail.  I have severe laryngitis and I cannot use my voice 
today or tomorrow.  Sorry.  We can e-mail or speak through Marie.  
Yes, we have a blackline.  Marie has finished going through it and I need to 
review (the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline 
so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline!).  Re: the 
credit support annex, I believe all is resolved.  However, I believe there is 
still an L/C issue.  If there is an L/C default (say the issuer is 
downgraded), Tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the 
right to post a  substitute L/C within two days.  I am not absolutely certain 
of this, but Carol has a 2 pm call with the lawyers and I will listen.  I 
don't know if Tiger responded to our guaranty.  I was out sick yesterday.  
Hope this brings you up to date.  SS

Just kidding!  I'm fine.  I've been cut off twice on telephone calls to the 
states so I may have problems calling you in the next hour or so when I leave 
the office.  FYI:
NTAP closed at 188-3/4 and CISCO closed at 132-3/16.  It's too early for the 
mutual fund reports.  The weather is again gorgeous; we had empanadas for 
lunch and they were much better than tamales.  I read the tamale article in 
the Oxford American and it talked about the tamale man in Greenville, MS 
(whose name was Six Sixty-Six, being the sign of the devil so the tamales 
were really HOT).  Tomorrow we meet with another law firm.  Thursday and 
Friday I meet with the commercial people about ISDA agreements and one 
business customer is flying in from the province of Mendoza to discuss an 
agreement.  I'll call you later and I'm going to try to go to bed earlier 
tonight (I'll try to call after 9pm BA time).  Love, the DG

I have reviewed Tana's list of North American utilities and have the 
following comments:

(1)  I have tried to eliminate all governmentals and regulated entities.  
However, I suggest that we ask Kevin Leitao to take a quick review for 
obvious errors.  (However, I don't want Kevin to prepare unlimited research 
on our behalf.  I'll discuss with him).

(2)  I suggest that we ask Canadian counsel to review Canadian utilities on 
authority/regulatory issues.  In my experience, Canadian outside counsel was 
reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than 
outside counsel's domicile.

(3)  The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to 
absence of litigation.  This rep drags in governmental bodies and all 
agencies (hence, a state PUC).  Thus, online parties will rep as to authority 
to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC 
issues.  (Under the ISDA, a party would have to notifiy us of a "Regulatory 
Development" and we may have an Event of Default for failure to notify; we

Ed:

Further to my voice mail of earlier today, the CI guaranty appears to be 
limited in duration but there is not a specific term.  How long must the 
guaranty remain effective?

Libby Rutherford would appreciate a short explanation from you regarding the 
cross default threshold.  She was interested in knowing which financials we 
were reviewing together with the explanation.  Our latest draft provides all 
parties with $100 million.

Attached is my suggested language.  The confirms already provide for Market 
Quotation and Second Method; the Optional Early Termination provision should 
be the only exception for using the Calculation Agent for termination 
purposes.  Of course, the Calculation Agent will determine AECO prices for 
payment purposes, but that is not related to termination.

Please call.  713-853-5620.  Sara

Also, I am checking the guaranty and other changes marked by DB.

Please note that I frequently see credit derivative deals between ECT 
Investments, Inc. and DB (unclear where EnronCredit.com Limited fits into 
thiis Houston picture!) where DB is requiring an ENE guaranty as well.  Do we 
need an ISDA here?

We are presently contacting Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to facilitate opening 
of an account for EPHXII to trade ADRs.  You will need to provide a 
resolution authorizing opening of the account as well as an authorized trader 
list and other contacts.  We will provide you with drafts.  I am certain that 
the broker will accept fax signatures and then follow up with originals.  

For future reference, will this be an isolated instance (i.e., deal specific) 
or will these accounts become more routine?  Just wondering if S. Cone has a 
formal trading policy or if trading is still deal specific.  SS

Hey Jack - I'm assuming you don't know the last name, but I'm betting you 
haven't known alot of other Tori's in your lifetime.  Anyway, I've been 
feeling nostalgic lately, so, I thought I would see what was up in your 
life.  I got married about 6 years ago, and I live with my husband, Pat, out 
in Katy.  I'm working at Enron downtown, doing commodity trading.  We're 
expecting a little girl in June, our first baby.  Anyway, I'd love to see 
what's going on with you.  Write back if you can.

hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am 
trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve 
been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to 
change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe 
$145 - can you verify?  thanks.  also - can you tell me if i won anything for 
making the semi-finals?

here are the two new index descriptions that we need:
 
For Socal Ehrenberg --  NGI SoBord Scal Ehr
For Socal Topock --       NGI SoBord Scal Top
 
 
Then, just to clarify on the PG&E Topock product -- here is the special 
language that we need to use -- "The volumes scheduled to be delivered are 
subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all 
interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating 
conditions.  The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and 
are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."
  
We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can 
come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational 
constraints.  I think this is close enough to the original language that it 
should not be a problem.  Thanks for your help.

without trading experience, the jobs that you would be interviewing for would 
be risk analysis or scheduling probably.  i'm not sure how much you make but 
i think it may be a pay cut -- not sure though.  you can send me your resume 
though and i have alot of contacts in those areas - i'll do what i can.

The 2 products will be EPNG Socal Ehrenberg and PG&E Topock.  The reason why 
we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit El Paso 
Merchant Energy from trading them.  The reason why we want to do this is that 
El Paso Merchant Energy is refusing to trade with us, the Western region, 
both on their online trading system, ICE, and also in the broker market.  We 
feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing 
field level.  I'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be 
directed to our VP, Mike Grigsby, if further explanation is needed.  Again, 
the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and 
they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on 
eol by 2/28 at the latest.  Thanks for your help.

hey andrew -- just seeing how things were going with you.  i was at dinner 
the other night with jojo and your name came up, so i thought i would drop 
you a note.  where are you these days??  things are pretty much the same 
around here -- trevor is planning a trip to come see me when the baby is born 
-- only 3.5 weeks til d-day -- maybe a little earlier if i'm lucky.  wasnt 
sure if i told you that i'm having a little girl -- she wont be spoiled or 
anything.   overall i have to say that pregnancy hasnt been that bad of an 
experience -- other than the lack of partying which in my case is probably a 
good thing.  keith holst was asking about you -- said to tell you hi -- so 
"hi".  thats all from h-town for now.  hope you're doing well.

i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you 
really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than 
understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.  it really 
hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than 
spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.  i can't talk to you 
about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.  once 
again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you 
wanted.  but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.  i love 
you!

Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).  My husband, Patrick( 
One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as 
well as elite members on several occasions.  We also use Chase Continental 
Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.  I have made 
Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own 
travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.  
This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.  I booked tickets for a 
vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on 
December 1.  Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from 
my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due 
to complications with my pregnancy.  My doctor indicated to me that I may not 
be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.  I 
spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he 
indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on 
September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I 
book a ticket for me or my husband.  I understand that this is the same 
policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel 
like taking a vacation this weekend.  In my opinion, this is an unacceptable 
policy in the event of medical complications.  As you can see with my 
situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a 
vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month 
old child.  I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help 
me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your 
policy.  I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.  He 
was very rude to me, stating "You don't have to ask me 7 different times for 
the same thing - I already told you NO!"  I had to cancel a flight for work 
about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping 
that I would be able to fly again by now.  For your information, your 
competitor was very helpful.  They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a 
credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another 
person's name if I am still unable to use it.  That ticket was also booked as 
a non-refundable fare.  Although I have always used Continental  for my 
personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has 
definitely made me second-guess my future choices.  If there is anything you 
can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.

We have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 
1st.  The descriptions are set up and ready to go, but we need to make these 
RESTRICTED products just like the EP Blanco.  The customer list, however, 
will be different than the blanco list.  We need to get on this right away.  
Please let me know what I need to do.

we had a couple of different deal numbers that we were using for december 
purchases from sg interests.  we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.25 on 
12/21 on deal 528768.  however, the next day - we bought a volume of 689 at a 
price of 9.84 on 12/22 on deal 510431.  the counterparty agrees with me and 
they will be reinvoicing us.

just got your email address from rachel.  congrats on your promotion.  i'm 
sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great 
deal.  my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago.  i love it there - 
my parents live about 10 minutes away.  new news from me - i'm having a baby 
- due in june.  i can't even believe it myself.  the thought of me being a 
mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 30, i probably need 
to start growing up.  i'm really excited though.  rachel is coming to visit 
me in a couple of weeks.  you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo 
stuff?  you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago.  it was 
the weirdest thing - heather evans.  i hadn't talked to her in about 10 
years.  seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her.  
anyway, i'll let you go.  gotta get back to work.  looking forward to hearing 
back from ya.

I ordered a computer and printer on the enron click at home program and i 
received a confirmation, but it seems as if it's only for the computer and 
not the printer.  My order number is 507208940.  Can you check on the status 
of the printer?  Thanks.

I'm feeling great - other than not being able to sleep very well - and this 
is just the beginning of that!   Anyway, thanks for forwarding Pat's resume.  
He does like what he is doing there most of the time, but I have been pushing 
for a little more stability from him to take some of the pressure off 
myself.  Thanks again.

Here is the way we would like to see the restricted list for the EP Blanco 
Avg products -- I have omitted and added counterparties.  Can we make these 
changes as soon as possible?  I would like to be able to tell the new 
counterparties as soon as possible so they can start clicking!  Thanks!

We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.  The location - PG&E 
Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change 
to the long description.  The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E, El Paso."  should be changed to "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change, 
as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as 
possible.  Thanks.

not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed 
like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous 
to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the 
group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do 
something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the 
birthdays simple.

Looks good but we need to talk about the index product because the 
decsription is too long as it stands now and we need to rename the current 
product and create a new one also

WOW!  Congratulations on your engagement.  I remember you talking about her 
at the reunion.  I'm glad your career is going so well - as if there was ever 
a doubt.  Well, my news is also big.  I'm expecting a little girl on June 
11th.  Talk about a life changing event.  Pat and I moved to Katy to live 
close to my parents and to have a bigger and newer house.  I really love it 
there.  It's hard to believe our 6 year anniversary is coming up in March.  
I'm still working at Enron - still trading commodities, and it's going really 
well.  Like I said before, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and 
catch up a little.  I know how busy you are, but I'd love to have your new 
email when you leave Seattle.  Until next time - take care and have fun 
planning the wedding!

the trader over there is JB Smith.  if you would like - you can send me a 
copy of the invoice, and we will send them a letter with the invoice attached 
- and tell them to stop sending invoices to you because we consider the 
issure to be resolved.

I have an open order that was placed on 1/2/01, and the availablity on the 
item said that it would ship in 24 hours.  I chose regular shipping, which 
should mean that it should be on its way.  However, the order status still 
says that it hasn't shipped.  How can I find out what it causing the delay?

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
products?  let me know...

we will agree to cancel these trades and reconfirm new ones.








Tori,

Please disregard my prior email - I mispelled Socal's email address.  Their
address is now correct.

As we discussed, Astra incorrectly confirmed the two imbalance trades
detailed below.   Tony at SoCalGas said he can cancel the trades if Astra
and Enron send him an email requesting the trades be cancelled.


Trades to Cancel:
-----------------
Confirm
Date  Agent Buyer Agent Seller Therms
------- ----- ----- ---- ------ -------
4/25/01 2640 A116 2527 2527  445,730
4/25/01 2640 A116 2587 2587  444,270



To confirm that you agree to cancel, then please forward this to him at
gtcalendar@socalgas.com and indicate that you agree.   (You can also hit
"REPLY ALL" since I cc'd on this email).   I will call you and let you know
what the new downstream contract will be.


Thanks

river trip sounded like a blast!  the pool is going well - next step is the 
deck and they are starting this week -- realistically they could be done in 3 
weeks.  pat got a job  - thank goodness - he starts next thursday -- he'll be 
working downtown at waste management.  it was a pretty good offer -- good 
benefits -- good company -- he's going to be working for the old boss that he 
had at bank united.  we will be able to carpool now - no more bussing it for 
me -- also, we just found out today that we got into the new enron child care 
center -- that was a big relief.  so -- things continue to fall into place -- 
we're keeping our fingers crossed that it continues...

i think pat and i have decided to wait until he can be listed on the loan 
before we actually lock this thing up.  we are still going to do it, but we 
both feel better about having both names on the documents.  can you tell me 
exactly how long we will ahve to wait after he starts working?

Hey Sheri.  How's everything going?  Hope you had a good time on your Vegas 
trip.  I haven't even had a chance to talk to Jen about it.  I had a question 
for you -- Do you know of any job openings that would be good for Pat.  I 
have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there.

we arent busy - looks like jen may be trying to put together a happy 
hour/early dinner for friday - she just sent me an IM - i'm assuming it's not 
in honor of your birthday because it wasnt mentioned.  i wont mention it if 
you dont want me to.  anyway - she did ask about you - said she hadnt talked 
to you in a while.  as far as i know - we have no plans as of yet for the 
whole weekend - i know how much you love football , but maybe we can just 
hang out on sunday and watch the game - make some good food - etc.  by the 
way - i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect 
right now - that was awesome news - i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime 
in the next 2 weeks- hopefully i can find out what i'm having!  i lost my 
waist over the weekend - definitely in the maternity clothes now even though 
they all look huge.  anyway - talk to you soon

thanks for your help - and, i hate to revisit this again, but can you send me 
a current list of the counterparties that have access to the blanco 
restricted product.  i am still getting complaints from people who should 
have access, but they are telling me that they do not.  thank you.

I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather 
Evans that I was friends with for so long.  So, I am finally writing you an 
email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori 
(Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping 
you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop me 
an email - let's catch up.

I'm so glad you wrote me back - sounds like you're a very busy person, but it 
looks like you're getting to do what you wanted to do.  As for me, I got 
married to a great guy named Patrick that i met during our last semester at 
UT.  We actually got set up on a blind date by Rachel Hanson.  Anyway, we'll 
be married 6 years in June and we're expecting our first child in June.  I 
spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for Foley's, but I now am 
doing something completely different that I absolutely love.  I work for 
Enron - big energy trading company - wasnt sure if you knew who we were.  I'm 
trading natural gas, and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and 
challenging.  My hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has 
not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good.  We bought a 
house in Sugarland about 3.5 years ago, but we sold it in August and moved 
into a new house that we built in Katy.  We wanted to be close to my parents 
and also closer to San Antonio - where Pat is from - his parents still live 
there.  Anyway - I guess that's it in a nutshell.  Oh yeah - and my address 
is:
4419 Stackstone Ln.
Katy, TX 77450
I hope we can keep in touch.  I'm not travelling right now, but if you ever 
make it to Houston - I'd love to see you.  Give me some more details in the 
next email!
Take Care and Happy Holidays!
 
 
Love, 
Tori

Ed  called me on the equipment.  I asked him if he could provide the 
computer.  I downloaded some inofrmation on EOL regarding technical questions 
which provides some of the requirements for EOL and sent them to him. Let me 
know if there is anything else he needs to provide.  I have talked to Julia's

The sound card does not work on my eol machine-it works on the keyboard 
supporting eol which is opposite of what I want.  I want the screen to ding 
every time someone trades on eol.  I don't want to listen to my self type in

PNM is incorrect.  The price is 4.86.

Tell them that the location of the gas is west texas pool and that we NEVER 
sell gas in the west texas pool based on a san juan gas daily price.  Once 
you tell them that they will realize that they are wrong.

It's not looking good to come visit you this summer.  Deb is moving into her 
new house sometime during th end of July and then she promised to take her 
nieces and nephews on vacation sometime this summer.  I think we are going to 
try for next spring or summer to come visit you if the offer is still open..  
Sorry- I'm sure you are disappointed.  However, if something changes, we will

Joe and I would love to attend the bowling party.  We would like to have 
prawns for dinner.  We are arriving on Friday at 1:30 so we shouldn't have a 
problem being there.

Does Joe need to being his suit for Saturday night?

What do you think about this strategy?  Maybe we should have Deb call Marion 
and review the list of hotels where Enron has a corporate rate and ask her 
opinion regarding which ones she would recommend.  Maybe -at that point she 
would volunteer her flat?

I want to penalize them for the volumes they are not taking on the trigger 
deal.  I know they are not going to pay but I still want to bill them 
anyway.  So- is the SW gas contract a one-way contract.  we are bound by 
their terms but they are not.

Since I do not track actual volume flows , you probably can contact Morgan at 
ext 36406.  She handles border flows.

RE: New York City
Looks like we leave Houston at 1:15 and get to New York at 5:52. We leave New 
York at 3:00 and arrive Houston at 5:49.  The phone number at the Barbizon 
Hotel is 212-838-5700.  Enron has a corporate rate there.  Suppose to be 
$222.00 Deb- if you want to try to get your own room-be sure to ask for the 
Enron Corp rate.

RE:  Europe.  There are several hotels in London which are listed as giving 
Enron corporate rates -prices range from $69 to 215.  The Ritz is $180.  I 
show no discounts for hotels in Paris.

If it is not too late I would like to put on hold my request to add Barrett 
Resources to the EOL Product for El Paso Blanco Average. I made the request 
yesterday so hopefully I am not toolate. Upon discussing the product with 
Barrett, I do not think this would be a good idea to add them at the present 
time.  I willkeep you advised.  Thank you for your patience.

Forgot to tell you that Joe and I went to see the Jim Rome show when he was 
in Houston a couple of weeks ago .  It was pretty good.  Too bad you'll never 
see him in Omaha.  Guess what else?  We got a memo today that Enron is giving 
all of its employees a home  computer and will subsidize their internet 
connection.  Gift is part of their commitment to techonology.  Does your 
company do this with your telephones?

Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation.  
Randy continues to do an excellent job.  He anticipates questions and usually 
has the answers.  He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on 
his knowledge base.  He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha 
points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very 
valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.  The only area for 
improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his 
opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say 
anything or go along with the status quo.  He tends to want to be 
nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment 
and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.

My broker called me this morning and asked me how I was doing and I told him  
again that I was coming to New York and he said no problem with getting 
tickets to Avita and the Lion King.  Easter next year is Sunday April 15.

Southwest Gas currently views Enron Online but is afraid to transact physical 
volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on Enron Online are 
different than non-EOL trades.  They stated that they reveiwed the EOL 
contract and that it does not address payment.  I told them that the payment 
terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.  Can you 
send them something.

Tickets are free.   I don't think we'll need binoculars-seats are on floor.  
Enjoyed helping you over the week-end-that's what friends are for-at least 
where we came from.  The flowers you sent me are beautiful .. All of my 
favorites-gerber daisies and liliies.  You didn't  to do that with all of the 
furniture you gave me.  By the way-are your legs killing you.  My calves hurt 
like hell-think it's from going up and down the stairs barefoot on Saturday.  
I think your decorator was a little disappointed in all of the progress we 
made.-he probably thought you would want to hire help.  Can't believe he 
didn't say anything about all of the beautiful glas syou have.  Hey-we may 
want to thin about putting one of your big mirrors in your purple/black 
bedroom next to the TV hutch-nearthat corner instead of in the purple/green 
room.

Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint 
against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.

The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts 
to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  
of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and 
the gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a 
minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.

The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the 
Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that 
this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to 
as Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could 
be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is 
implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock 
border and must match up with the intra-state transport.  

SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock 
delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the 
capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They 
also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum 
of 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if 
their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo 
until the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being 
established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.

Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a 
reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.

After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:

Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not 
relate to receipt point rights.

1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);

2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)

3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or 
Ehrenberg.  It is recommended that they
 give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up 
like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from 
Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.

4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:

   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock
Texaco   40    135
Burlington  26    74
Aero   5    15
Borax   7    12
LADWP  0    36
SWGas   0    20

5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:

Expansion Shippers  78000 
Socal Gas           425000
BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 
El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)
Total 851000
540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.

The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and 
felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off 
the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.

Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El 
Paso's counter -proposal.  

Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent 
thruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other 
forms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge 
Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as 
converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the 
producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, 
they would not pay anything.

Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their 
deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For 
volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric 
rate.

Bottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this 
case.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will 
study  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.

Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived 
gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more 
gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could 
be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  
El Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan 
based on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle 
2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings 
andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a 
technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets 
resolved.

Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the 
keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the 
bondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, 
Southern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you 
advised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions.

Hey:
Sorry I've taken a few days to respond.  Just the more I think about it, the 
worse of an idea it seems for both of us.  There is nothing good that can 
come of it either professionally or personally.  I still regard you as a good 
friend.  Nothing has changed that nor do I think we need to act weird around 
each other going forward.  Something I think we both wanted to try and we 
did.  Maybe best left there though.  
John

Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product 
priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really 
shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the 
predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.  

One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new 
product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated 
basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated 
basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec 
Nymex.  Any ideas?

The $5,000,000 extra VAR disappears in about a week.  There MUST be a 
band-aid to the term VAR curve before this expires.  Again, the back of the 
board is realizing 35-60% vol and it's being credited with 15% vol.

A couple things about the limit orders:

1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise.  

2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000.  

3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

Thx,
John

Andy:
The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on 
the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  
Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all 
strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, 
making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 
cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller 
size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower 
delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a 
market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the 
money.  
Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way 
wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 
4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 
3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a 
strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate 
having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.

In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles 
struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for 
what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying 
to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier 
for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more 
sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if 
someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to 
call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a 
market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would 
anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just 
the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.

a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to 
switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing 
plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the 
gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at 
$1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test 
of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management 
keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too 
many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy 
prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  

funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 
friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each 
front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.  

what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas 
switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market 
too oversupplied to care?

Dave:
I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this 
power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC 
in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a 
mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them 
with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a 
way to generate false P&L?

Had Carlos Franco just shot a 49 yesterday instead of a 70, you would have

Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of 
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost 
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.  
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play 
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more 
bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out 
below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy 
is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up.

Russell:
I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill 
Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an 
extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone "who thinks outside the box".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years 
and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.  
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within 
reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.

I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that 
Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This 
was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing 
models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since 
been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  

Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting 
credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.
Thanks, 
John

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological 
$4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next 
sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with 
williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of 
the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common 
here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe 
in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some 
shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were 
trying to break $5.

Dutch:
The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to 
two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics 
book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold 
longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a 
reflection of my view of the market. 
Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was 
transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until 
this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's 
position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.

Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about 
how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we 
post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server 
automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we 
immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as 
it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on 
ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market 
gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was 
that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which 
system you like better.

Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will 
be implemented shortly.

I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing 
a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance 
of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 
2-ways and killing the broker markets.

remember when you said there is a reason they call them bear spreads?

bring up a chart of f/g or g/h.   
f/g is tighter now than anytime since march 99 when ff1 was worth 2.50

So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this 
week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got 
totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all 
the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the 
length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy 
inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, 
just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to 
keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.   
With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going 
to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and 
hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.  
Leads to more upside potential in short term.  
My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell 
side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales 
have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was 
cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from 
california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.   
i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that 
with little downside.  Thoughts?

I spoke to Vlady this afternoon regarding the alternative VAR methodologies.  
I think changing to a Riskmetrics historical VAR system is more defendable 
and objective, will provide more consistent results, and will create more 
realistic results.  I understand Vince has a similar opinion.   
John.

I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The 
area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, 
long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need 
to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf 
group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas 
trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and 
the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....
thanks for the article.

A funny story:
Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of 
unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the 
exchange stopped trading for an hour.  
Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything 
was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange 
closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...
"Why don't you take your million dollar bonus and go buy Enron stock"

Andy:
This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that, 
unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between 
numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an 
unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the 
decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until 
the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going 
forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you 
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with 
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your 
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you 
bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?  what 
you charge me play against you?)

Jeff:
To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing 
in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back 
rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  
The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is 
pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and 
vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

Looking out for you bubbeh:
John

I apologize for the comment after your order.  I knew you didn't like the 
market last night so I was surprised when you were an buyer this morning.  
It's not your style to change views quickly as you tend to trade with a 
longer term view.   I was out of line with the comment and it won't happen 
again.

Due to VAR reasons, you and I  both need to sell today.  Vol and price are 
going up, implying Enron can carry fewer contracts today than Friday.  Have 
your desk net sell 400 today.

I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and 
maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is 
$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing 
ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher 
clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.  

Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El 
Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long 
futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin 
costs.

Ruth:

In follow-up to our telephone  conversation,  I am confirming that it is my 
analysis of the purchase agreement between CES and ENA that ENA must refund 
to CES any transportation refunds it gets relating to the CES transportation 
contracts that relate to activity prior to January 1, 2000.  Likewise, if 
there are costs relating to such contracts prior to January 1, 2000, those 
are the responsibility of CES.

I hope this helps to clarify the situation.

The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery 
points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you have 
any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should look 
identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a detail 
of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty 
names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet 
normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the 
prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.

Judy -
I just heard from Kim Hundl in Confirms that you had a discrepancy regarding 
a Short Term West Hourly deal entered for 4/4/01. Deal 570892 was originally 
entered as a buy of 5 MW for hour ending 11. Then the trader extended the 
deal, which is something Real Time traders do often, but when they do they 
rarely modify the deal in EnPower Deal Entry. They simply make the change in 
Scheduling. Because of that, unfortunately, you can only see the true total 
volume of the deal in our scheduling system.

At any rate, I've corrected the Real Time sheet for 4/4 to show the correct 
volumes for the correct hours; and I'm terribly sorry for the confusion. 
Please feel free to call me or e-mail any questions you have regarding EPMI's 
coverage of EES's load. I'm noticing that nine times out of ten, the 
discrepancies originate when Real Time is hurriedly sending spreadsheets to 
you guys and not making sure that they match the deals we have in EnPower. 
Also, I was wondering if you could tell me what database or report you're 
looking at to tie out our deals with your records. I think if I knew more 
about your perspective, I'd be able to help more efficiently.

Attached is the revised Real Time spreadsheet for 4/4. And again, please call 
with questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Thought it would be a good idea for you to have a copy of this.

Hey there Mr. Real Time. Looks like you did a deal with Pacificorp on 11/28 - 
EPMI STCA buys 8 MW @ $60 for hour 2. These eight silly little megawatts have 
unbalanced our book and driven the schedulers to near insanity. No, just 
kidding. But I think there should be a sale of 8 MW from Nevada to Mead on 
hour 2 somewhere in there. I don't know - I'm not the expert, which is why 
I'm asking you.

Will you please let Lisa Gang or me know how to fix this. I'm more than happy 
to do it, just wanted to double check with the man who created the mess in 
the first place. (Kidding again.)

Kate

my name was on the list of missing paychecks for the end of last month? Kathy 
Axford said she gave you such a list on 12/30.

Les Rawson has spoken with Doug Reiner at Willamette regarding this deal. 
They are in agreement now about the prices. Les said he usually has to 
explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so 
it's nothing new. But in the future, Les said he'd prefer to contact the 
counterparty first to avoid confusion. His extension is 3924. You're also 
more than welcome to call me first and I'll track Les down. (I think I'm 
probably easier to get ahold of!) 

At any rate, I hope this clears it up. And if Willamette has any other 
questions, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Yeah - I pretty much became part of the furniture yesterday as I recouped 
from the brutality of that weekend. I ended up at a random friend's house at 
about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about 
6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a 
cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I 
definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by 
my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen 
cocktails. All in all, though, great party.

Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her 
number is 703-853-3001.

I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own 
curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her 
group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, 
SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to 
include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. 
While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, 
she said. 

I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our 
real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in 
Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until 
that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of 
petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check 
that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More 
information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.

What better time to start thinking about the winter holidays than on 
Halloween?!

Just a reminder that our happy little office will be hosting a Holiday Party 
& Benefit Auction on Saturday, Dec. 2, beginning at 6 p.m. and lasting until 
the wee hours of the morning. We hope that everyone will be able to attend, 
which is why we're reminding you while the smell of pumpkin-insides and candy 
corn is still fresh in the air.

We will be holding a benefit raffle and auction again this year, and all 
proceeds will once again be matched by Enron Corp. Donations will be divided 
between Portland's Raphael House, a shelter for battered women and their 
children, and the Court-Appointed Special Advocates, a group that assists 
foster children and at-risk youth throughout the court process.

But who said charity couldn't be a hoot? There will be a pangea of prizes and 
a gaggle of goods for everyone (think Blazer tickets and autographed Blazer 
basketballs!). And a BAND! A swing band! It will prove to be the most 
fantastic Holiday Party this office has ever had....

The Confirms group in Houston has asked me to obtain a copy of the 
confirmation letter you come up with for this deal. This group is responsible 
for keeping records of all confirmation letters, whether or not they execute 
them. So this includes term deals that are marked "no confirm." Please let me 
know if this is okay with you.

Thanks,
Kate

Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes 
the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that 
you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping 
bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, 
but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well 
here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of 
people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you 
left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, 
some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of 
this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status 
of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the 
computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner 
that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, "What does 
it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a 
disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?" 
They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most 
things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of 
authority, as in, "No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly 
be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market 
right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at 
a time like this?" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is 
why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the 
great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office 
will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to 
coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through 
the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, 
and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to 
say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an 
amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I 
believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and 
constantly refer to you as "my good friend Winston who's skiing across the 
state of Wyoming, which was my idea." I'd love to hear about your trip direct 
from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and 
killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write 
back....if you can still move your fingers.

Sincerely,
Kate
(the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look 
constantly busy)

471740 - Bob Badeer checked with Natsource. This is their deal. Broker 
mistake.

471315 - This was PGET. It's been changed.

471588 - This was 12/3, not 12/4. It's been changed.

I've added the third leg to deal 566375 and changed comments in each leg to 
reflect that. We had a bit of confusion about who was actually adding the new 
pub code, but it's in the system now and the deal is ready to be confirmed. 
Just a note - I previously had all the Sunday and Holiday hours in the 
off-peak leg of this deal (so Risk could calc the value correctly), and now 
I've deleted those strips to account for leg 3 which contains only Sunday and 
Holiday hours. Please let me know if anything looks different, other than 
that, on your end.

Hey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new 
city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was 
there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise 
mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept "sticking it 
out another month" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and 
buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days 
frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully 
speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I 
can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we 
know, or would like to know.

It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something 
new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think 
you'll know if Denver is really "your kind of town." In the meantime, just 
take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll 
take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not 
meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so 
pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to 
explain: when you walk into Mimi & Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, 
and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether 
or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, 
maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, 
just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it 
home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a 
habitat, but you get the picture.

Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are 
characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't 
matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces 
of....well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk 
- away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you 
what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was sooo sweet, soooo smart, 
soooo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came 
crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, 
escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as 
"Brian's Trip to Portland." It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can 
tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to 
love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday 
with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew 
it.....constantly. 

Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give 
you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you 
really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone 
at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell 
to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile "the rest of our lives" are 
slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, "Life is what 
happens when you're busy making other plans." Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.

Love,
Kate

Just FYI -
The tie point and Cal PX deals we uploaded this morning did in fact load as 
Enron Online deals. Oh joy!

I talked to Will Smith, who said he thought he'd heard this complaint before 
and very cordially agreed to take a look at it. I just thought I'd keep you 
informed of the latest episode in what I'm sure will be an award-winning 
series. (How about "The Good, the Bad, and the Cal PX Bridge"?)

I've got one more deal that Houston says they haven't received a signed 
confirm letter for - 420529. Stephanie Piwetz says she spoke to Grant County 
and they said they already sent out that one and 432854, but haven't received 
them back from us......???? Do you know where they are?

Kate


(From 2/26/01)
Just something to keep in mind - 
The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant 
County for the following three deals -

432854
420554
420563

I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the 
letters on to them once you receive them. Or you can give them to me and I'll 
fax them over. Keep me posted on the progress.

Thanks,
Kate

Please accept my apologies for this worksheet's absence yesterday. It was 
undergoing cosmetic improvements to more accurately represent the EES-EPMI 
position. Note two new column headings as of 3/27 - "Transmission" and "Other 
EnPower" deals. Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2 
sheet. This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI. 
And as always, feel free to contact me with questions.

Dave -
I'm the new Deal Control staff person here in the Portland office, and I've 
been told you're the person to contact regarding counterparty match-ups for 
our futures deals this month.

The futures were done today, and if you could let me know of the 
corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out, that would be very 
helpful. If there is anything I should know about your job or how we might 
help each other work better, please let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name 
"California Department of Water Resources - CDWR" to "California Energy 
Resource Schedulers - State of California." The following deal numbers are 
those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most 
likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me 
know and I'll change those counterparty names too.

510867/860/857/853/775/774

She didn't "warn" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a 
peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails.

But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was 
changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be 
re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and 
changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. 

And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never 
really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information 
to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our 
jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much 
I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better.

I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, 
tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with 
every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm 
there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped 
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is 
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski trip 
this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let 
alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally 
used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and 
not eternal grayness. 

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, 
but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever 
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, 
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is 
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course 
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got 
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore. 

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE 
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, 
or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll 
definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or 
not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can 
get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll give you a call 
from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate

After researching the position further, I am very much interested in formally 
applying to work in Deal Control. I have spoken with Jeff Richter, Val Sabo, 
and Carla Hoffman about the requirements and responsibilities of the job, and 
I have a good understanding of the kind of candidate they're looking for. I 
feel I fit that profile and am excited by the challenge it presents.

I have also spoken with Mollie Gustafson and Chris Calger, who have given me 
their support in pursuing another opportunity within the company. (Although 
they would be understandably heartbroken.) 

Please let me know at your earliest convenience how to proceed in applying 
for this position. Thank you for your help, Amy.

everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of 
our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, 
which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in 
Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've

I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

Thank you all for being so patient with me while I am under Carla's wise 
tutelage. Hopefully I'll be up to speed in the next few days, but if you 
notice me doing anything insanely wrong, don't hesitate to yell.

One thing that has lagged slightly, but will be making a comeback tomorrow, 
is the Deal Correction Report. Every afternoon I'll check up on discrepancies 
noted by Houston and determine the source of the error. If the source of the 
error is you, me, the broker, or the computer gods, it will be noted in the 
error report and given to Risk Management to assist them in their daily 
calculation.

Thanks again,
Kate

To re-cap:

I've changed three Short Term West Hourly deals to reflect what all parties 
have agreed to - EPMI sells to Sierra Pacific Holding Co., HE 23-24 on 4/28, 
HE 1-24 on 4/29, and HE 1-6 on 4/30. Instead of selling to the Automated 
Power Exchange, we'll be using them as the broker, paying a $.03 per MW fee, 
and selling to Sierra Pacific. Following are the changed deal numbers, for 
reference:

595705
595714
595819

I believe this should clear up any discrepancies we had among different 
counterparties' invoices. Now all we have to do is cross our fingers....no, 
just kidding. Please let me know if you have questions, or if problems arise 
from these changes.

Thank you,
Kate

Looks like we might have to modify this name in EnPower after all - The dba 
on our master agreement is "Sierra Pacific Industries" with no "Inc." at the 
end. I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that, 
although the company is a corporation, they never use "Inc." in their 
contracts. Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master 
agreement because of those three pesky letters.

Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you. In case you'd 
like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 - 
it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Sean Crandall just changed both of these deals. 464181 should have been a 
buy, and 464182 should have been a sale. Hope that checks out correctly - we 
couldn't find Diana Scholtes anywhere.

Thanks,

My oh my - it's a rare occasion when I am greeted by such entertaining 
e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note, even if it was just a 
covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by 
the way, if I could do that, you can bet we would have already had rolling 
black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.

Yes, I did finish the book. It was very interesting, although it did lose me 
for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send 
another book along with it called "Liar's Poker." I just heard about it and 
it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall 
Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its 
stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes 
for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.

No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get "Heartbreaking 
Work..." She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself 
later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come 
to her senses and quit being evil.

Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This 
statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know, the one 
that comes after "One Meeeelllion Dollars....") But study up and make us all 
proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi, and study....or pay the price later.

Kate

P.S. What the heck is your address anyway?

Finally! After a slight uphill battle, we've successfully entered the first 
three futures deals under the Mid-Columbia NYMEX settlement price. Because 
all of you were involved in this process in one way or another, I thought I'd 
let you know that it was successful in the end, and forward the deal numbers 
along for reference. They are as follows:

TAGG Futures Deals - QQ0362 (J-01)
               QQ3837 (K-01)
                  QQ7050 (M-01)

ENPOWER Swap Deals - 517925 (J-01)

Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. -

Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of 
Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under 
the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master 
agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list 
in EnPower.

Thank you all for your help on this, and I appreciate your future assistance 
in getting this deal out of the "New Counterparty" void.

Thanks for your concern - that's so sweet of you. I think it's a combination 
of too many hours staring at a computer and too few hours sleeping - mixed in 
with a good dose of mid-winter blues. I'm sure a day on the slopes will do me 
good.

How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December? Why is there a 
man parked outside my office incessantly tooting "Jingle Bell Rock" on his 
horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I 
began this e-mail with lines of whining?

I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in 
Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in 
years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of 
the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting 
to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless 
e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, 
but that's what makes everyday interesting.

Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - 
saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to 
satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big 
holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no 
apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop 
hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in 
(or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.

Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to 
remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people 
who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I 
heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? 
Or ugly?

Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd, 
and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great 
vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season.

Kate

Portland West Desk lawyers have completed the application to become a 
participant in the Dow Jones survey at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points. As 
soon as possible, we would like to begin executing deals against these 
indices. In order to do this, we will need to access to them through EnPower, 
in both Deal Blotter and Deal Entry.

If you could facilitate the addition of these two indices into EnPower, we 
would appreciate having access to them by Tuesday. Please let me know what 
steps we need to take at the West Desk to help complete this process. To the 
best of my knowledge, we simply need the ability to choose the Dow Jones 
NP-15 or SP-15 index in the PubCode list in Deal Blotter and Deal Entry. We 
also need to be assured that when these deals are settled, the correct data 
will be pulled into EnPower from Dow Jones. 

Thank you for your help and cooperation. I will be in touch on Monday.

the SP-15 deals for 4/2. I'm sorry it's taken me a few days to get back to

Following are the deal numbers for interdesk swaps between STCA and STWBom 
for Monday and Tuesday. I'm sorry again for forgetting on Friday.

587941
STCA sells 25 to STWBom
4/23/01
$231.23
PGE3

589743
STCA sells 25 to STWBom
4/24/01
$266.00
NP-15

Let me know if you have questions on these. I presume Phil talked to you 
about why he put the deal in at PGE3 for Monday and NP15 for Tuesday. 
Apparently it doesn't have any relevance until FSP is up and running, but it 
may affect you guys differently. Just let us know if it's a problem.

How did you know Steve Smith would be my first choice for a Blazer date? 
Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.

Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative 
assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the 
Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and 
stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths 
every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her. 

Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great 
weekend too. Don't forget to take a moment of silence for our past Presidents 
on Monday.

Kate

I notified Jim Fell and Terrell Gault of the delay in getting the documents 
to them, and Jim actually said he had both the Business Plan and the EIS and 
therefore didn't need either. Hopefully the Business Plan will arrive from 
BPA today and I'll send it off to Terrell.

Also, I'm sorry about the errors on the place cards. I was in a hurry to get 
them out to Sir Not-So-Speedy and overlooked those details. I hope it didn't 
cause too much confusion.

Questions about this deal - 

1. Should energy type be CAISO? 
2. Should trade date be 3/7?
3. Should confirmation status be "NO"?

I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before 
changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals 
marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just 
a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the 
confirmation status.

Thanks,
Kate

I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet. It should reflect the latest 
volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing 
between EES and EPMI. Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an 
attempt to feed them through to the CARP report. Please let me know if you 
see the changes come through, Mark. 

The autoscheduled deals are:

533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
535419 - 3/2/01
535420 - 3/2/01
566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
550208 - 3/15/01



The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES 
saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours 
should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the 
EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet. 


+____________
=         1016.75 

Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the 
CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up 
for March!

Thanks,
Kate

Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each 
day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me 
know if this plan suits you - 

1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with 
EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the 
total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should 
solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.

Kate

After a little more digging, I've found that the deal NYMEX was referring to 
is the same one we dealt with a month ago. I spoke with Tracy Green, one of 
our contacts at Avista, and she had been dealing with the same issue all day. 
Apparently, when Avista first incorrectly reported that we hadn't made a 
payment, it set off a domino effect of doubts that seems to still be falling. 
So NYMEX called EDF Mann, our futures clearing broker, today to assure that 
payment would be made today.

Tracy had been speaking with her broker at ABN-AMRO; I had been speaking with 
ours at Mann; and NYMEX had been communicating through both of these entities 
to us. I've left a message with John Croddock at NYMEX to discuss this 
directly with him. His number, if you'd like it for your own purposes, is 
(212) 299-2146.

Other contacts are Tracy Green, Avista, at (509) 495-8535, and Gary (?), ABN, 
at (212) 859-1212.

As far as Avista, ABN, ED&F Mann, and EPMI are considered, the March Palo 
Verde futures contract has been paid, and paid on time. I'd like to speak 
with John at NYMEX to tie up any possible loose ends on this. Please let me 
know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

I know I already discussed time off at Christmas with you, but I have really 
indecisive parents who are divorced and like to do completely opposite things 
for the holidays, so I have one modification to make. If I could take off 
from Friday, Dec. 22, to Tuesday, Jan 2, then I can accomodate both of my 
parents and head off a potentially disastrous fight over which kids go with 
which parents. It ends up being two more days off than I had asked for before 
-  the 22nd and the 2nd. I'm really sorry to ask for so much time off, but I 
wouldn't do it unless my life were going to be in jeopardy if I didn't. Thank 
you!

I actually did get that last e-mail, but somehow it ended up buried at the 
bottom of my in-box, just like so many other things. As far as the Blazer 
ticket trade, I believe I bought a call from you on the Laker game, and you 
bought the option from me on the Cavaliers - so I can choose to exercise on 
12/13 at 7 p.m., and you can choose to exercise on 1/16 at 7 p.m. In other 
words, no matter what happens, I'm going to both games. Got it?

As far as good stories from that night, I probably have the best, or at least 
one of the more hilarious, of those circulating the floor. And no, it has 
nothing to do with me. Ask me about it later, and I might be able to give it 
up for firm delivery of a seat at next week's game. Think about it.

I've ordered the 1999 Annual Report for Scottish Power, as I noticed it was 
not in the company file. It should be here tomorrow or Friday at the latest. 
If you need the information sooner than that, I can download the report from 
the company's website, although the document is understandably bulky. Please 
let me know if you'd like a print-out.

Also, if you'd like, I can talk to Sue about CASA's financial needs. Mollie 
and I had discussed splitting the auction proceeds between two charities; in 
that way we can share the wealth and not inundate an organization with more 
than they can manage. It's something to think about in case CASA doesn't need 
much help.

But 465821 stands as Enron had it - we sell to Deseret.

I just spoke with Kim Hundl in the Confirms group. She's been told by PGE 
that they do not want confirmation letters sent for daily deals. Apparently 
there are a bunch of these in the system under your desk that are noted to be 
confirmed. The confirms group can change all of these deals to "no confirm," 
but they wanted to double-check with you guys first. Do you agree with PGE, 
or would you like these deals confirmed? Let me know.

"Pretty tired" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off 
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise to 
only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm not

You know, "date with destiny" is getting a little old. Can you come up with

I'd like to introduce myself, as I'm sure we'll be in frequent contact in the 
coming weeks while I adjust to my new position at the Deal Control desk here 
in Portland. Please feel free to call or e-mail me with questions, concerns, 
alerts, or suggestions - I'm eager to learn as much as I can about this job 
and take it in new directions. So if there is anything I can do to make your 
jobs function more smoothly, let me know.

As a first order of business, thank you for the heads-up on the new version 
of Deal Entry. A couple of our schedulers have been experiencing delayed 
efficiency with the program  today - I'm not sure if that has anything to do 
with the new version or possibly our Terminal Server connection. Just wanted 
to let you know, in case anyone else has the same experience.

I look forward to working with you, and again, feel free to call me anytime.

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

While you guys were all busy worrying over the California energy crisis, I 
slipped down to Mexico to conduct an investigation of how our neighbors even 
further to the south are faring. Do they still have lights? Is the AC shot? 
Can they even make a blended margarita?

Seriously, though, I will be out of the office on Friday, Dec. 22, and again 
from Wednesday, Dec. 27 to Monday, Jan. 2. I realize this is late notice; I 
did let Richter know awhile ago, but I probably should have spread the word a 
little further. I am truly sorry.

At any rate (below the price cap of course), while I am gone I would be so 
appreciative if one of you could run the Dow Jones report in the morning and 
the EOL report in the evening. Dow Jones will only need to be taken care of 
from Wed. through Fri. of next week. I will call on those days, and I can 
easily explain the procedure over the phone to those of you who don't know 
it. If I call and you're ridiculously busy, just hang up on me. I'll call 
back later.

The EOL report we have come to know and love is actually being fixed right 
now. I will talk with Nicolay Kraltchev, the Houston IT guy in charge of 
fixing it, on Friday, Dec. 22. It should be up and running again by Friday 
afternoon. Again, I'll call to check in and make sure this works, or explain 
how to use it.

I'll be in the office on Monday, Dec. 25, just briefly to make sure it hasn't 
exploded in my absence, but then I'll be off to the land where tequila is 
better for you than water. Sounds terrible. Please don't hesitate to call if 
you have any questions, or problems, of the work sort, of course.

Beginning tomorrow this report will contain Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE)  
trade numbers and volumes, in addition to EOL and brokered deal information. 
Please look for that information at the beginning of the e-mail. Also note 
that the ICE data is released one day later, so it will not correlate 
directly to the EOL data below it. (i.e. Daily EOL Summary 3/1 will include 
ICE data from 2/28) Enjoy...

I think I found what you're looking for:

www.ferc.fed.us

Once you get to the home page, click on the "gas" icon. From there, hit the 
link to the "FERC Gas Tariffs Page." Then it gives you a choice of viewing 
the tariffs in HTML or saving them to a different file. 

I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to review this information. The website is 
updated every 30 days, or so it said, so you may just want to keep it 
bookmarked and check it out whenever you need the information.

If I totally missed the mark, please let me know and I'll keep looking.

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

Mom -
I know how if feels when things start building like that. I'm finding that 
"alone time" is really the only way to cope - especially during the holidays. 
But don't worry about getting upset - you have every right. I am really sorry 
that I haven't helped you with Anna's finances, but I've felt so overwhelmed 
just making it to and from work everyday that I haven't managed to fit in 
much more. Just when I think I might be getting on top of things, I do 
something like lose my glasses, which then takes priority over everything 
else I thought I would finally be able to do, as I cannot see a word I'm 
typing at the moment. IThe madness is neverending! I hope it's comforting to 
know that no one has it anymore together than you do.

Kate

God, that's so nice of you to thank me. So many of my students just spread 
their little wings and fly away, forgetting that I MADE them goddamit. 
Anyway, I'm glad you had fun in Maui. I honestly think it's pretty much 
impossible not to. I'm getting ready to go back, hopefully at the end of this 
winter when I'm nice and frostbitten, in time to see the whales, which by 
then will be like my family as I will have spent the previous six months 
porking out on turkey and stuffing and washing it down with quarts of eggnog. 

If you're planning any more trips in the future, my full list of city guides 
can be accessed at www.katerockstheworld.com. It's a start-up operation, but 
I plan on retiring in about.....wait, hold on.....I just retired.

See ya!

Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully 
you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a 
chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the 
Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and 
we've got a chance at the championship! 

I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with 
Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm 
not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've 
retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the 
floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more 
urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season 
tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so 
to speak. 

In the meantime, feel free to contact me with news about deals, discounts, 
free tickets, a date with the team, etc. (ha,ha)

As you may have gathered by now, the West Origination Group has purchased 
season tickets to see the Portland Trail Blazers on their path to 
championship glory. We have four seats which will be used primarily to 
entertain customers and foster outside business relationships. 

Please look over the attached schedule and determine the game dates you would 
like to reserve. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-serve 
basis, so be sure to plan as far in advance as possible. Games that have not 
been reserved as of three days prior will be distributed internally or given 
to outside parties. 



If you have any questions or would like to reserve tickets, please contact 
Blazer Command Central by e-mail, telephone, or in person. Include the date 
of the games you would like to go to and the name of the customers you will 
be taking.

Business

PALO ALTO, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Advancing its leadership in the 
application integration space, TIBCO Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TIBX -
news), a leading provider of real-time infrastructure software for 
e-business, announced today Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTAP - news), the
leading provider of network-attached data access and content management

To integrate these disparate systems and ensure that the right people within

Appliance turned to TIBCO.

``We need an integration tool that will not only enable us to share

McCormick, director of business applications for Network Appliance.
``TIBCO's proven e-business solutions provide us with the scalability, 
security and reliability we need to ensure that our technology infrastructure 
can
keep up with our business growth, and just as important, that our vital 
business processes not be disrupted as we continue to implement new 
solutions.''

information infrastructure that connects every system and process in the 
enterprise,''
said Fred Meyer, vice president of product management for TIBCO Software.

Appliance further leverage their front-end and back-end IT systems and bring 
those systems closer to customers and partners over the Web.''

Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel.

2.  TAS   Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players 
with locals opposed.  A motion was passed to    add expiration day to the 
current TAS pilot program.  The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board 
in the    next few weeks.    

3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the 
weekly storage data.

I have a seat for Frank and I am working on Gil and the rest of those guys.  
Ina is out until Thursday, but I will be giving her a call at home this 
morning to see what can be done.  I will coordinate the move as  soon as I 
have a space.  Meanwhile, I am checking with the guys periodically to meet 
their needs while they are on the 31st floor.  Call me if you have any 
further questions x35193.

Kimberly

US Govt. data - 


 Business inventories rose 0.9% in June, exceeding analysts' expectations
of a 0.6% rise and matching the revised May figure. Retailers saw the
biggest increase; their inventories rose 1.2% in June. Total business sales
were also up 0.9% in June, a slightly weaker showing than the revised 1.1%
rise posted in May. The inventory-to-sales ratio--the number of months it
would take to empty the nation's warehouses, store shelves, and sales lots
at the current rate of sales--remained at 1.32, just off its all-time low.
In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in July,
double the pace in June. Industrial production, which measures output at
U.S. factories, utilities, and mines, is now 5.8% stronger than it was this
time last year, due mainly to continued growth in high-tech manufacturing.

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction
Process With FERC

FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative 
regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity
auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.

In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for 
selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. 
The filing
was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is 
consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which
encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' 
to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637,
Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance 
filing made June 15.

``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party 
that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of
Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we 
conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often
wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current 
process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the 
auction is
closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''

According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving 
to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into
consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in 
capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term
contracts.

Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via 
its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm 
capacity.
Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the 
quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted
capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if 
Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with 
a
different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a 
present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time 
before a
binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.

Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles 
outlined in FERC's Order 637. 

    *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will
          begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be
          posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).
    *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-
          discriminatory basis.
    *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing
          EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be
          made available on the Internet.
    *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since
          bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to
          each capacity package made available.
    *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's
          identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection
          criteria were applied.
    *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all
          bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to
          all bidders through an Internet-based system.


``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity 
auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all 
parties
as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.

Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is 
based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for
transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to 
withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.

Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and 
Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to 
have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in 
Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your 
reference.

thanks,

Scott

Rolo and I worked together in BA.  Rolo did a great job for us, focusing 
mostly on gas but he did do some work on power as well.  
He is very bright and has a great work ethic.  He has gained a fair amount of 
commercial experience (including "trading" natural gas) in Argentina. I would 
recommend him highly.

Kathy Kelly EXCELLENT    The performance of the group in the area of 
operations/logistics is superior.  Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and 
is able to get performance form her people.  Even with the dramatic growth 
of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very 
high level of performance.  I think Kathy could improve in the commercial 
area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve 
our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..

Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of 
operations/logistics.  Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to 
operations/logistics.   I would like Ed to improve his ability/wllingness to 
make decisions.   Very little commercial understanding, although shows 
interest in learning.

No- the conclusion is incorrect. The peakers help to mitigate the risk 
created by market positions. Maybe just change the last sentence to read 
"Because the peakers offset the contract, the VAR is substantially reduced. "

Sounds fine to me. Does it make sense to run resume past Brown and Sherriff

I was really hoping we could do this on a best efforts basis with all of us 
covering any issues arising during the month of December. Since there seems 
to be insistence on a date certain there is no choice but to have Steve start 
in EBS on 1-1-2001. Ted can't physically be there until then. It will be 
difficult to have full RAC responsibility without physically being there.

I guess I don't have strong feelings if a dash is written here or not but I 
do care that a troubled situation receive the attention it requires to avoid 
getting in deeper. There always seems to be reluctance in UK to have a dash 
prepared, Steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task. 
We all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse. 
Maybe Michael could be led to "suggest" an alternative memo or approach. A 
"problem deal" memo. If you all think a dash is the best approach do it and I 
don't care if they don't sign it.

Once the website is functional, it will be helpful to have a complete history 
of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process. 

One final thought, Michael is quite supportive of our effort and I think we 
should pick battles carefully. Rick

Activity levels in Credit Risk Management (CRM) have never been higher due to 
very volatile commodity markets, growth in EES and many other factors. In 
order to address these market changes, effective now, Ken Curry will transfer 
from Rick Carson's Due Diligence group to CRM and report to Bill Bradford. 
Ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to 
immediately add value to the CRM group. 

It is fortunate that adequate depth exists within RAC to be able to realign 
personnel as market needs suggest. Please join me in congratulating Ken on 
his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment.

I attend a regular meeting with AA and Rick Causey discussing EES internal 
controls. They have asked for a detailed presentation on :

-EAM business
-Tariff curve summary and positions against those curves
-Credit issues in general.

I will try and get more details for this but we should get together soon and 
get it organized. EES may attend but not present. I think we should give them 
an overview of the business and what needs to be accomplished in each of the 
above areas. Probably a one hour mtg but maybe two. Lets try to meet next 
week. 

Karen- please set up.

efforts and others in RAC as well. Thanks for the feedback. Rick

Mark- here is my response to your request. Call with questions.

Goal:
Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD.

Performance:
Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee 
Dec 11. The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on 
earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over 
the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to. Also, a 
template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes 
in the future. Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure 
prior to this activity. As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging 
activity resulting from this effort.

Goal:
Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES.

Performance:
Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across 
EES. A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results 
presented to the Finance Committee. A RAC task force has been put in place 
which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has 
agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit 
control systems where they need to be. Significant progress has been made 
against these recommendations. DSM projects have been spot tested with 
outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES. These tests have 
highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best 
employed.

Goal:
Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London.

Performance:
Complete and Ongoing. During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC 
which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking 
place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to. A data base 
system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these 
offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to. 
Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really 
understand where we have risks. It also helps in defining where we don't have 
responsibility such as EOTT,  Azurix  and The New Power Company.

I think you should arrange for a formal presentation of this material to 
myself and other folks in RAC. I believe this is the direction of future risk 
control activity and all of us need to be updated. Scheduling something after 
the board meeting would be helpful. Tx Rick

This looks good. Possibly don't need last two items , we need to decide when 
to review this once it is live to see if it is taking off. Also, what does t 
aking off mean? Certainly after a month. See what others think about this 
list and then we can decide what our plan should be. I'll talk to you in a

Louise Kitchen, who is now the President & CEO of Enron Net Works and I had a 
conversation about the space located at EB2801.  Louise had no objection to 
RAC occupying this space since her buildout could not occur until May.   The 
space rental should be allocated to 011/100068 and 011/100052 equally.

Thanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. 
After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most 
appropriate for my needs. Would like to also consider the 36 foot model. 
Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at 
the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at 
most everything there in detail).

As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I 
want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or 
used, I may be interested. Again, I would need your help in obtaining 
appropriate dockage( in someone's backyard!)

Thanks, Rick Buy

Just met w/ Skilling and Whalley. 

Var for gas has temp increase of $15MM until next friday (12/15/2000).
Jeff is calling for an executive comm mtg to ask for an additional $40 MM of 
corp var until next wed (12/13/2000).

One issue is UK power will be over VAR everyday starting probably thurs or 
fri of this week, unless we increase them as well. (They sweep retail deals 
into book once a week on this day). This increase only needs to be $2-3- 
million.

Fasten seat belts and apply oxygen masks.

submitted on Friday.   Thanks.

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London. Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and mange the RAC activities which include credit and market 
risk and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market 
Risk activities. Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a 
new assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port 

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company. Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

After rereading 3 times I see your point. Didn't mean it that way. Before I 
sent it out I had Ted and Karen review as well as another person in corp. 
None had any comments. I asked Dave Gorte if he saw anything negative in it, 
he did not. Didn't mean to slight you in any way and I apologize if I did.

It is with great sorrow that I must announce the passing of Andy Knight, 
manager in the Market Risk Group. Andy succumbed to cancer on Feb. 22, 2001 
and will have funeral services in Florida. There may be a memorial service 
here in Houston arranged through his church but details have not been 
announced. Please contact Veronica Valdez for details.

Andy was with RAC and Enron only briefly before being diagnosed, but made a 
real impact especially on those that worked closely with him. Andy had  a 
warm and personable style, which along with his technical capability, made 
him a real asset to the group. He will be missed.

Chip is assigned to North America primarily but we asked him to get up to 
speed on the India situation in case a new deal should arise there that 
requires RAC input. He is a sharp guy with lots of project finance experience 
and also worked in London for Eastern.  If you don't want him involved and a 
transaction arises it will be difficult to get someone up to speed quickly, 
given the complexities. Rick

Missed your call  today and I will be in RAC PRC all day tomorrow. Basically 
Jeff said we must get this exposure down but gave no parameters to the 
statement. He did ask if any recent issue is causing us concern to which we 
said no, and I also said we know more about this company than any other 
exposure we have (which we should).

I also spoke with M. Kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w/ TXU to 
pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract 
is a good idea, rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank. 

Moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with TXU 
through the plant purchase or other structured deal. Do no more (large) deals 
with TXU that significantly increase credit exposure ($10mm??) unless we buy 
a derivative that reduces exposure simultaneously. Continue to stay on top of 
TXU with frequent meetings with their management to maintain a close 
relationship with good communication.

Lets try and discuss Wed if possible.

Spoke w/ Skilling re OI "binary" decision. He is willing to enter into the 
deal. His rational is that he thinks we will be ok on OWC in the final 
analysis. He did  say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as 
appropriate for the circumstances. He also wanted to know if there is 
anything different here than on OWC. I told him that it wasn't significantly 
different (both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached)

Lets get dash completed and then I will voice mail Jeff w/ specifics and get 
his verbal signature.

The Board meeting has concluded and I can now focus on the task force. The 
following people in RAC have been assigned to this effort as follows:

Legacy Opportunity

Molly Harris
Teresa Seibel
James Copeland
Michael Tribolet
Jay Hachen
Minal Dalia
Don Rollins
Rick Carson
Jeff Soo
Debbie Brackett
Sue Vasan

On Going Opportunities

Denise Fury
Mark Wilson
Dana Smith
Andrew Greer
Martin O'leary
Jay Hachen
Dave Gorte
Darren Schmidt
Vladi Gorny
David Port
Jeff Soo

This is a huge commitment of staff from RAC and will strain us no end, but it 
is necessary. If you want RAC to lead this effort I will appoint Michael 
Tribolet to manage the task. If you want someone else to manage the  effort 
we will assist as we can. Regardless of who leads this effort we need 
following:

Commitment of EES back office staff people 
Commitment of IT resources
Commitment of Skilling to fund the overage to the RAC budget, which I am 
under huge pressure to reduce, not increase.

Let me know how to launch this program.

The above transaction was presented to the Board on 1-29-2001. There was 
considerable discussion which I have summarized below.

Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk. I answered 
positively, which is what the capital price addresses. The dash return is a 
blended debt and equity return.(?)

Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate. I 
answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be 
needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.

Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon. 
I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal 
and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below 
outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully.

Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? 
Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come 
into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough 
cash to operate.

This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and 
not a rubber stamp.

Thanks for your note. I want to wish you the best of luck in EES. As far as 
RAC's issues with EES, I would suggest getting together with Tribolet and 
getting some of the lists that have been put together as part of the task 
force. I would also suggest attending the task force meeting, providing EES 
management is agreeable, to get a better picture of what is going on.

Again, I hate to see you go but it will still be value added to RAC and 
Enron. Have fun!!

A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our 
procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate 
action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we 
have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard 
was going on there. 

We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there 
isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate 
action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. 
More to come.

Spoke with Ben Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that 
we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area. Can you prepare 
a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a 
meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically 
a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria 
and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that 
would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in 
economics and of course a skim. 

Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.  and 
proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a 
Friday (23) meeting.

Thanks, Rick

Thanks for the feedback. I sent my best guy there so I hope there is 
improvement. We have been talking to a candidate for credit that Ted will be 
discussing with you soon. Hopefully we can make progress there also. I want 
complete buy in from you and John on this guy before we proceed.

Separately, the scrap metals meeting we had with Causey went well. We will 
reconvene in two weeks to see where we are.

Thanks again for the feedback. I was a little worried about Ted after the MD 
disappointment but it seems he has recovered.

should submit to Kim.  If so, should I forward it to Kim or do you want to

Dave Forster from Eol may be calling you.  I am trying to get the Hub online 
and I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the 
Midwest Hub.  An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.  I have asked Dave to 
call you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.

EOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is 
EOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an

The two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a 
basis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages 
this product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be 
selected for index calculation.

I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the 
product the index or product description in the index page.  I think the 
index calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.   How fast can the 
index page be calculated and posted?

Technical issues

1) When some of the members of the chat room begin to talk, their microphone 
volume starts to trail off.

2) Many of the users use the ctrl button in their daily activities.  The talk 
button needs to be changed to an F# key.

3) We have trouble with latency.

Please contract Brent Tiner to help with these issues.

Thank You
Hunter

I feel like such a heel.  There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I 
had placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.  Thank you for continuing 
to look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.

I had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked 
for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn 
the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group 
to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the 
front-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person 
can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants 
front-end production to be handled by her group.  

We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It 
seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the 
group will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow.

Dave

 

can you redo with day + 1 products only?  Also can you display the data 
without placing multiple data in a given row?  I have attached an example.  
The first row in this spreadsheet is how I would like to see the data.  This 
way I can sort the data in any fashion.

Thanks
Hunter

I talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If 
the Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every 
"Midwest Hub" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the 
Chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a 
problem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura 
manages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above 
agreement.

Thanks

Mark,

Did you have a chance to review the E&P company model
(the old cash flow mode) and determine if it can be used
by Fred Lagrasta' group.

Greg,

As a follow up. We are talking to Jay Webb today about the data we can get 
from
the Enron OnLine system to develop an early warning system  for automated 
crude trading.

By the way, it was a good catch. You left us red faced.

Dear Dr. McMullen,

A few weeks ago I received a call from your University
regarding employment opportunities at Enron.

I called back and summarized the  needs of my group (an ideal profile of a
candidate):

1. mathematical finance
2. computer programming (C, C++)
3. understanding of the energy markets

I shall appreciate any information about potential candidates.

I have also given some other suggestions regarding potential
opportunities for graduates with different profiles.

Please, feel free to call me. My number is 713 853 3848.

Molly,

Sandeep Kohli called last night.  We decided to transfer Anshuman
for the 6-month trial period and then extend his assignment
to a permanent employment if necessary. For Sandeep Kohli
it's a permanent transfer, effective immediately.

Some local opposition to poaching of good people.

Dear Dr. McMullen,

A few weeks ago I received a call from your University
regarding employment opportunities at Enron.

I called back and summarized the  needs of my group (an ideal profile of a 
candidate):

1. mathematical finance
2. computer programming (C, C++)
3. understanding of the energy markets

I shall appreciate any information about potential candidates.

I have also given some other suggestions regarding potential
opportunities for graduates with different profiles.

Please, feel free to call me. My number is 713 853 3848.

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Christie,

I have two persons in my group helping me with the Wharton and
Rice projects. By the way, the project I gave to Rice students is
exactly the same as the project for Wharton. We shall see who is better.

Their names are Li Sun  and Kenneth Parkhill.
Can we invite them to the dinner on the 18th and to the meetings
on Friday?

Norma,

I would like to proceed on two fronts with Sevile (both H1 visa and
the Green Card. I shall rather work hard to keep my employees happy
here than try to attach them to the job through immigration arrangements.
They can see through such arrangements and it de-motivates them.

Kevin,

Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer. Clayton 
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on. Vasant will formulate 
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold  Clayton  to it. If he fails to deliver the request for 
transfer will be rejected. Anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody.

Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) 
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be 
aware of it, because I have
serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

John,

I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and 
elimination of
risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being 
aware of risk
does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.

Now a few more detailed comments.

1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined 
with 
a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view,
should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without 
sufficient depth.
One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The 
approach used in valuation
of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of 
investments in physical
assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized 
through other aspects
of valuation technology used in RAROC. 

If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent 
and use
this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that 
I recommend this course of action).

2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.

Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.

He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the 
floor for
the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as 
opposed to taking a vol
risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes 
fuzzy.
The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on 
two factors:

1. risk preference
2. existing portfolio positions

Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that 
consists of two parts:
expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 
standard deviations.
The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability 
to absorb the loss.
I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We 
looked into insurance pricing at the
request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more 
about it.

Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease 
the risk of the overall portfolio.
I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not 
look to me as a deal that reduces risk
(given all our positions in this region).

What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the 
utility function of a decision maker
in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary. 

If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged,
we should subtract from the value of the contract
the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value).
If we don't price this option explicitly,
the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk 
premium.

In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot 
hedge, he should recognize the risk
of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of 
the option.
How big is the discount? See the comments above. 

In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton 
paradigm applies, both values
will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form 
the point of view of 
a seller and a buyer will converge.

3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?

We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will 
recognize the downside and/or
upside at different points in time in different states of the world).
If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of 
NPV as of today.
Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases 
we are still holding
it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is 
equivalent to using a 
discount rate with a risk premium.

I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a 
delay in responding
to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we 
all agree.
It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not 
have
good answers.

Jeff,

I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 - 
30 minutes
to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze.
A separate message about  this visit will follow.

I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships 
with
different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of
the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our 
presence
on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.

We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get 
the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we 
are not
very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses
and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:

1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently  
underwriting two research
projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor  
Nicholas Bambos
(a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation
of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.
Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain 
access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and 
also to lock-up some very
promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such 
programs.

2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every 
presentation
I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes 
and hiring decisions.
It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic 
program. In many cases,
the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach 
them during their 
senior years.

3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. 

Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to 
getting the best students
and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important 
in shaping public  opinion
on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of 
deregulation and design of new markets).

Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on 
personal commitment of a number
of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and 
focus.

I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) 
responsible for coordinating
our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from 
our Analyst/Associate
program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.

Shirley,

My Power Point presentations for Peoples'
presentation,

I need color transparencies.
I don't know how many B&W copies we need. 
You can ask  Lynn Pitofsky about the number
of participants.

Mark,

I fully agree with you regarding general trends. I see  great progress in 
software 
applications that facilitate the process and make it almost painless to the 
end-user.

With you permission, I can show the material you sent me to my son, who 
studies
 computer science, and ask him for his view.

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.

I will be attending the ski outing - I am not sure about my arrival and 
departure dates, but I did put tentative dates. Once I make my bookings I 
will update you on my final dates. I might stay an extra day, and will pick

Louise,

Those numbers are impressive without a doubt.  The success has had the 
unfortunate consequence of showing the limits of our current internet 
technology.  The delays in messages from the stacks to the website have 
gotten worse in recent weeks.  This is only anecdotal evidence but as a 
trader on the system it has been very frustrating.  


Regards,

i don't think our rosters have a good trade match because i'm sure you are 
not ready to deal Davis and Robinson. Ricky was my # 1 pick for a reason and 
Warrick is the only decent receiver in Cin.  the two guys you are offering 
are not top players.

I assume that the tokenized products for gas daily and daily basis with 
continue to be coded for my book on a forward basis.   I also am assuming 
that the Henry Hub products have been moved to FT East who is now managing 
them.

Thanks for your help

Richard,

After going throught the numbers on this peaker. I can only pay 4-5 cents for 
a 10 day peaker at Chicago. That would be a net payment to you of 
$604,000. 

You are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and I will pay 10% of the 
underlying price to get the optionality.  As a relative value NYZ6 or Socal 
is worth much more.  Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest 
out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too 
liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.  

Call me to go over the numbers if you want

The main issue that I see with the description you sent me is the same one 
that we spoke about a few weeks ago.  

 What should the consistent market convention for determining the first 
tranaction be?  If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the 
premium swap as the "first transaction"  and the discount as the second.  
This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the 
calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have 
to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.  
Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would 
eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  I 
will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.  The product 
description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily 
be able to determine the correct direction to trade.  

I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get 
back to you .

Thanks 

Pete

Please approve my authorization request for control over daily and monthly  
basis products on enrononline.  
I will need these products available for management on my stack manager. I 
currently cannot access basis products on my stack manager.  They were 
removed to facilitate timely messaging updates between my stack and the 
website.  
I will be managing monthly and daily  basis products for the East Desk.   I 
will also be retaining my management of gas daily products for the east desk.
I will be managing these products as of 10/2/2000.

The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for 
existing products in the next few weeks. 
The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades. I know that the Gas 
Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some 
work. 
I should have a list of new locations shortly.

Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things 
happen.  

Thanks,

Pete

Kyle is doing fine. Larry is doing pretty well.  We are actually buying Z6 
vol for the first time in years.  

As far as the rest of the stuff I am so far outside the loop on these things 
my desk has a different zip code.

Dale,

To follow up on our conversation, our only problem is in the short 
description. We would like to make in simpler. 

Possibly  reading  " Gas Daily Index" as the product type

Also it seems that the long description in product manager  that we approve 
while  copying  a product does not match the long description after the 
product is created ???

Louise,

Thanks for your reply to my email.  

The fixes implemented over the weekend appear to have worked extremely well.  

I am sure that the changes your team made also contributed to the record  147 
external and 263 total trades that I executed today.

Thanks for all your help.

I put in an offsetting trade for the phys/financial swap.  You will have to 
process three confirmations to get it done 2 offsetting phys and 1 
financial.

US Gas

Liquidity

EOL has allowed Enron to simultaneously provide internal and external 
customers with realtime  markets in many of the physical and financial 
products that we trade.  The ability of all customers to execute trades and 
receive instantaneous confimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes 
and growing customer participation.  One of the benefits of this system is to 
allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled 
through third party brokers.  

Enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer 
spreads. This committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since 
rollout last Nov.29.


Transparency

The existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness 
of bids and offers.  We will trade on the price and volume on our bid and 
offer.   The growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on 
the sometimes unreliable broker served market.  Many of our customers and 
competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading 
vehicle.  EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on 
as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.  We have no 
competition in this regard.  This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the 
smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.  

Deal Flow

As the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading 
benefits.  We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and 
over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.    Enron's market 
share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become 
the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market.

oh how the truth hurts. As a Texas resident i can tell you that Bush is by

Dale,

Please let me know the status of the creation of Gas Daily index swaps. I 
believe that you have been talking to Mike Grigsby on this issue.

I created the April Gas Daily swap this morning please approve this product 
also.

Hi Carolyn,

GE has asked for an explanation of the relationship of Pegasus to Delta Power 
(in other words, the equity structure).  Could you please ask Greg if DP can 
send an email with that explanation, so that I can pass it along to GE.

Hi Scott,

I have some questions:

The obligation to try to improve performance  about the specific performance 
(ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months.  Do you 
have a sense for the appropriate time period here?  Would it make sense to 
require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?

Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we 
need to put words around it.  I know we discussed the need for pilings as the 
most significant change.  Do you think that this difference is enough?  Did I 
understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard 
foundations (as opposed to a credit). 

On termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason 
for termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some 
monitoring ability.

On assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty.  I was thinking of using 
something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations, 
perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity.

Do we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact 
payment?

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is the latest revision, incorporating comments from the Enron team.  
There were some comments which were either discussion points or not readily 
decipherable, so those will need to be addressed in the next version.  
There's still some harmonization/nit stuff which we will pick up then also.  
Hopefully, David Hunt (MDEA's lawyer) and I will hammer out the more 
legalistic (yet important) stuff while he is in our office tomorrow.

Ed, maybe we can schedule a call with our local counsel to get some  more 
comfort on the authority issue.   In addition, we can ask for an 
authority/enforceability opinion from MDEA's counsel.  We'll beef up the reps 
as well.

Reagan/David, Ed's availability is best first thing tomorrow (Thurs) morning. 

See you soon,

Kay

I'll be in meetings in and out of the office until around noon.  

I sure would like to get out of here by 600 tonight.  Wish me luck!

Thanks for putting the dogs out and taking Michael to school.  Sorry about 
the doggie accident.  It will take time.

I checked the kindergarten website, but it didn't have any info re Wear White 
Day.  I can pretty well figure out what he is supposed to wear (white), but 
I'm not sure why.  I believe the 19th is MLK's real birthday, if that has any 
significance.  That's not much info, I know...

Hope you have a good day.

Fred,

As we discussed, we need the physical addresses where the equipment in 
TurboPark is being stored.  As I understand it the equipment is in at least a 
couple of places, and we haven't advised the banks of that fact.

Thanks,

Kay

John,

I made the changes you suggested. 

The prior version contained a non-circumvention (you can't pursue the project 
without me) versus the current exclusivity (you must work only with me), 
which seems somewhat more restrictive since it would keep us from bringing in 
additional participants.  I've changed language in the next paragraph to 
avoid a contradiction.  



 If we go with this approach then I suspect we will want to work on an LOI 
which divides up responsibility going forward. Let me know what you think. 

Kay

Do the LM facility agreements for DevCo turbines need to contemplate ENA as 
an agent?  Will it specifically be ENA, or an ENA subsidiary?

Guess what?  The closing party isn't until Feb. 8.  I had the wrong week!  
Glad I didn't show up on the wrong day....

BEAUTIFUL weather.  Might want to sit outside and have a little cocktail (or 
equivalent) tonight.  I had Mexican food for lunch, so popcorn for dinner!

Love,

Nancy,

Thanks for the wonderful turn around time!

I glanced through the interconnect.  It includes arbitration (poor Dutch) and 
equipment outage as force majeure.  Gee, what's good for the goose should be 
good for the gander.

Talk to you soon,

Hi there,

I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.

Here are some questions/comments:

I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =
=20
I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what=
=20
rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role o=
f=20
the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that=20
familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll wo=
rk=20
on it.=20

I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of "substantially=20
similiar" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.

Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.

I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
=20
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.

I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=
he=20
assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=
d=20
financials, but I didn't comment there.

I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20
own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added=20
"construct", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.

Enough explanation, here it is (with Word file attached below):



Except for as described in Section ___ [ next paragraph], neither Party sha=

I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:

We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.  Do we intend to reference a 
particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?

Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the 
final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the 
draft?  I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the 
backside with that one.

Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?  

I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files 
(haven't checked closely yet).  If anyone has it handy, it could speed things 
up for me.

Thanks,

Kay

My trip may be back on for tomorrow.  I'll know more later.  

I have a meeting from noon-500 this afternoon, at the Hyatt.

Today looks crazy.

Does Charlotte know how to pick up Michael, and about Rosco?

Love,

ckm

ABB is struggling with a fundamental assignment issue.  Their concern appears 
to relate to assignment to a project company or contractor which might not 
have the financial ability to pay.  I believe they are looking for some type 
of security (LC, bond, guaranty).  I didn't sense that they have an issue 
with the identity of the assignee, just the ability to pay.

Comments?

Kay

Gentlemen,

I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on 
certain tasks.  Here goes:

Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the 
outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.  Roy is 
putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.  Gregg and I 
decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the 
agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft 
which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.

Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's 
review.  Here's the draft:

Gregg and I need to review it.

Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list.  
Since both sides are running behind on this,  David prepared a very straight 
forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing 
the task.  Here it is:
 

Policies - Gregg "Policy Man" Penman has been working on a credit policy, 
cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of 
others I'm forgetting.

Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system 
to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.  He has raised the issue 
of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.  Also, it may be 
necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid 
before any distributions are made to either member.  This is still under 
internal review at Enron.  I will check around to see if Corp (the lender) 
has a form of credit facility we should use.

Miscellaneous:
Decide about services agreement
Confidentiality agreements 
Transfer pricing documentation
Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master)
Board resolution appointing officers/managers
Budget and marketing plan 
Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list)

Hope this is helpful.

Kay

Hi there.

Could you send me the Word final of the master GE contract which was the 
basis for the subsequent facility agreements?  I don't have it in Word- just 
WordPerfect.

I think you can just include the electronc file and the appropriate person 
can print it off when they print the Word file with the rest of the 
contract.  I don't have any better idea than that.

Mike Sandridge and I finally spoke on the phone.  Here are the issues which 
need to be addressed to keep things moving:

1. Which transformers go where?

2. How do we deal with the two cancelled units and any cancellation charges?

3. ABB has not had a good experience with an Enron LLC arrangement, and the 
contract allows for them to request payment security.  Unless they are 
convinced that they aren't at risk, they will want some form of payment 
security.  The contract does allow for the equipment to be paid off (except 
retainage) to facilitate the assignment.

Mike is available Thursday to discuss these issues, and how to get the break 
out contracts closed. I'm available any time.

Here is the current draft for your review.  In addition to the changes which 
were made, there were some valid comments made by Beck and Christi, which I 
think need to be addressed, but can be addressed in the definitive agreements.

Please revise carefully and let me know if you have any comments.

Karen,

Please send me the revised version with the language you believe reflects

Please email me with the specific performance language you want to add to

That's a lot of money for music.  I wonder how they picked that as opposed to 
something else?  I'm betting on a Taylor Symphony Hall - that's building 
money.

Here's the final final final.  I had to put in a page break before one of the 
exhibits because it wasn't printing right.

I thought the conference was pretty good.  I had a great room, with a HUGE 
jacuzzi tub.  Did anyone get promoted?  No one said anything about 
promotions, so I figured nothing interesting happened in that regard.  

I've been throwing out accumulated paper today, cleaned out my person, got 
out some clothes to give to the maid.  It all feels good.

I'm going to do email now.  See you tomorrow!

Hi Pete,

We want the GE form to be on an individual turbine basis.  As for work 
priorities, I would put it in front of the City of Austin agreement.

conditions for each such Unit has been provided by Purchaser to Seller, 
Seller and Purchaser agree to amend the Guaranteed Levels and the Specific 
Performance Levels for each such Unit to reflect changes in the Basis

12.2 Storage of Unit(s).  Seller and Purchaser recognize and agree that the 
period or periods during which any of the Units identified and listed by

or both.
12.3 Maximum Period of Seller Liability.  To the extent any Unit identified 
and listed by serial number in Exhibit P is placed in storage as contemplated 
in Section 12.2, the duration of such storage period shall be added, in the 
case of each such Unit, to the six (6)-year period identified in the last 
sentence of Section 27.1 for purposes of calculating the maximum duration of 
Seller's liability with respect to any such Unit and with respect to this 
Agreement.
12.4 No Effect on Cost, Schedule or Scope of Work.  Seller and Purchaser 
agree that implementation of the provisions and agreements of this Article 
XII shall be at no additional cost or result in any other change or impact to 
or upon the Scope of Work, Purchase Amount or Guaranteed Unit Delivery Dates,

Hi there,

Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of 
both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets? I 
want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.

Thanks,

know that ENA is willing to accept all of what he wants.  Please call to

Nancy,

As difficult as this is to believe, we have been told that VEPCO wants Enron 
to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement.  Please put this on 
your list.  I will check around here to see if there is a form we want to use 
as a starting point.

Gorman's will be picking up/delivering on Tues/Fri.  They had Mon/Thurs 
available, but Monday am is too hard to remember.  Besides, Delmis may be 
able to bring our clothes in on Tuesdays, and I'm generally home early on 
Friday.

Our driver's name is David.  His cell phone is 713 545 4186.  We can call him 
if we ever need pick up/delivery on a different day.

He will leave us a sack today.

How's that for cool?

I suggest that Exhibit S state that GE has received all sums owing, without a 
reference to who paid it, since they will have been paid from multiple 
sources.

Since AEWhite will be out of the office for the next two and a half weeks, 
I've volunteered for to cover her power development work in Florida.  Just in 
case you don't have my numbers:  office 713 345 7566  home 713 973 6325 cell 
713 314 8716.

As a  heads up, I believe Rose Engeldorf, the Global Finance lawyer who helps 
us process documents, will be on vacation beginning June 2.  Anything which 
may need to be blessed can probable be done a bit more easily before Rose 
leaves.

Pete,

I have a question.  Is it necessary for the amount of consideration to be 
listed in the final lien form (exhibit R or S, something like that)?  If so, 
what amount goes in there?  Will this defeat what we are trying to do in 
keeping the original price a supposed mystery?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Gaye,

We are looking forward to seeing you and Earl this weekend.  We will have 9 
for dinner, not counting the 6 year old who will have eaten (although he will 
eat a piece of bread, if offered).  I just hate to pay for a real dinner for 
him when I know he won't be interested in grown up food.

If it isn't too much trouble, could you email me the menu?

We will be bringing beer and wine.

See you soon (just not soon enough),

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.  


Kay

Don't forget that Global Finance is supposed to review these.  They have the 
turbine contract.

Hi Steve,

I wanted to send this to you before I send it out to others, since I feel 
like there were changes we had discussed that somehow didn't make in the last 
draft.   Guess you can say this is a sanity check!  If it looks good to you, 
then I will send it out, unless you prefer to make distribution.

Kay

Hi Cindy,

Any more sign ups from Enron?  I'm thinking of sending  a reminder out in the 
next day or so, and I wanted to see if you  have anyone other than me, 
Heather and Anne.

Thanks,

Reagan,

I've requested the issuance of a draft master (gas) for Clarksdale.  Yazoo 
has theirs in hand, but I haven't heard any of any comments.

The power side is a bit more complicated.  Yazoo City and Clarksdale have not 
cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power - whether it should be 
bought  by MDEA (easier in some accounting respects, but credit is more of an 
issue) or by the individual Cities.  

Maybe this should be on the list for our 300 meeting.

Kay

Re:  Acquisition of General Electric 7EA Turbines

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Pursuant to our discussions last week, the following summarizes the main=20
commercial terms agreed to by NorthWestern Corporation (=01&NorthWestern=01=
8) and=20
Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") regarding NorthWestern=01,s purchase thro=
ugh=20
the LLC referred to below or as otherwise accomplished without violation of=
=20
the Turbine Contract referred to below (the =01&Purchase=018) of two (2) Ge=
neral=20
Electric (=01&GE=018) 7EA combustion turbines (the =01&Turbines=018), the f=
irst of which=20
is presently located at a GE storage facility, and the second of which is=
=20
scheduled to be available for delivery in February, 2002, and both of which=
=20
are subject to purchase from GE under an agreement with GE dated as of May=
=20
31, 2000 (the =01&Turbine Contract=018) with respect to which ENA has the r=
ight to=20
cause a joint venture limited liability company in which, prior to commerci=
al=20
operation of the Turbines, ENA holds a 20% equity interest and a wholly-own=
ed=20
NorthWestern subsidiary (the =01&NorthWestern Subsidiary=018) holds an 80% =
equity=20
interest (the =01&LLC=018) to become the purchaser:

1.  Purchase Price:  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbin=
es=20
(subject to adjustment as described below). [Adjusted how?  Need specific=
=20
reference. Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent=
=20
with the structure?  Definitely sounds like a UCC deal,  for what that=01,s=
=20
worth.]
2.  Closing Date of Purchase:  The Purchase will close on a date on or prio=
r=20
to September 1, 2001, as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days=
=01,=20
written notice to ENA,(provided that such notice may not be given less than=
=20
30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement relating to the=20
Purchase).  [What happens at closing?  Payment of the balance?  In the=20
interim are we going to be obligated to perform under the GE contract in a=
=20
certain manner?  Are we taking on implied obligations to NW?]
3.  Cash Down Payment:  NorthWestern will pay ENA an $8.0 million down=20
payment for the Turbines.  The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0=
=20
million down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement=
=20
with ENA providing for the Purchase.  The second installment ($5.0 million)=
=20
of the $8.0 million down payment will be due at the earlier of (i) closing =
of=20
the Purchase, or (ii) July 15, 2001. [The remaining $40m due at closing, as=
=20
well as any other amounts due to changes, etc?]
4.  Liquidated Damages:   If, prior to the assignment of the Turbine Contra=
ct=20
[is proper reference to closing?], the purchaser under the Turbine Contract=
=20
receives any liquidated damages under the Turbine Contract, then ENA will=
=20
give notice thereof to NorthWestern as promptly as possible. [Then what?]
5.  Carry Period:  ENA will provide an interest-free carry on the unpaid=20
purchase price of the Turbines until July 15, 2001. If the closing of the=
=20
Purchase occurs after July 15, 2001, then the unpaid purchase price of the=
=20
Turbines will be increased by interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the=
=20
unpaid purchase price of the Turbines ($40.0 million) for each day from, an=
d=20
including, July 15, 2001 to, but excluding, the closing date.
6.  Dual Fuel Conversion on Unit 2:  ENA will not proceed with this change=
=20
order to effect the conversion.  Instead, it will be the responsibility of=
=20
NorthWestern to effect the change order with GE.  [does this mean they will=
=20
be negotiating a change order while E Next is still the purchaser? Are we=
=20
committing to pay for the increase?  Does the purchase price increase?  Is=
=20
there a limit?]
7.  Unpaid Price of Second Turbine:  At the time of closing, one or more=20
installments of the purchase price of the second Turbine will be payable to=
=20
GE under the Turbine Contract (the =01&Unpaid Installments=018).  ENA will =
be=20
obligated to pay the Unpaid Installments to GE as they become due under the=
=20
Turbine Contract.=20
8.  Guarantees:   There will be no guarantee by Enron Corporation of any of=
=20
the representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities or other obligation=
s=20
of ENA in connection with the Purchase.  All obligations of the LLC under t=
he=20
Turbine Contract, as well as all obligations of the NorthWestern Subsidiary=
=20
to ENA in connection with the transaction, will be guaranteed by NorthWeste=
rn=20
Corporation.

[governing law? Limit on remedies/damages for this letter? Dispute resoluti=
on?

NorthWestern and ENA have acknowledged that, subject to review and approval=
=20
of the structure of the Purchase and the negotiation of final documentation=
=20
relating to the Purchase (which documentation will incorporate the commerci=
al=20
terms set forth above), the above commercial terms have received all=20
necessary NorthWestern and ENA internal approvals. [Is this true for Enron?=
] =20
In light of this acknowledgement, NorthWestern and ENA (by signing this=20
letter in the space provided below and returning the same to NorthWestern)=
=20
agree to negotiate, in good faith, to agree upon such structure and such=20
documentation, with a view to executing and delivering a mutually acceptabl=
e=20
definitive agreement relating to the Purchase as promptly as practicable. F=
or=20
the avoidance of any doubt, it is expressly stated, acknowledged and agreed=
=20
that each of NorthWestern and ENA must be satisfied with such structure and=
=20
such documentation in its own discretion.

[I question whether there is enough wiggle to keep this from being a bindin=
g=20
obligation to sell]

By agreeing to the commercial terms set forth in this letter (by signing th=
is=20
letter in the space provided below and returning the same to NorthWestern),=
=20
ENA grants NorthWestern, and NorthWestern grants ENA, an exclusive =01&no s=
hop=018=20
period through the close of business on Friday, April 13, 2001; and ENA=20
agrees that, during such =01&no shop=018 period, ENA will not discuss or ne=
gotiate,=20
directly or indirectly, with any person or entity other than NorthWestern f=
or=20
or in respect of the purchase or other acquisition by such person or entity=
=20
of the Turbines; and NorthWestern agrees that, during such =01&no shop=018 =
period,=20
NorthWestern will not discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, with an=
y=20
person or entity other than ENA for or in respect of the purchase or other=
=20
acquisition by NorthWestern of turbines from such person or entity..  As=20
consideration for ENA agreeing to such =01&no shop=018 period, NorthWestern=
 will=20
pay to ENA, via wire transfer on the date of receipt by NorthWestern of ENA=

will not be subject to refund by ENA for any reason or upon any circumstanc=
e=20
(including, without limitation, failure of NorthWestern and ENA to agree up=

the structure of, and enter into a definitive agreement relating to, the=20
Purchase). =20

If ENA is in agreement with the foregoing, then please so indicate by signi=

this letter in the space provided below and returning the same to=20
NorthWestern (by facsimile at 605/978-2840 and to the attention of the=20

Hi Cheryl,

I'm looking for the executed version of the contract with Westinghouse for 
the 501D turbine, which I believe was originally headed to Panama.  ENA is 
looking to use it in a project or two, and I need to give a look.  An 
electronic version would be fine.

Thanks,

Kay

In a recent discussion with Mark H, he suggested that I consult you two 
gentlemen about outside counsel in Chicago to support our efforts with 
Peoples.  It would be beneficial to have a firm on board with some trading 
expertise, as well as more generalized transactional experience.  Gas would 
be a plus.

I've used Jones, Day  (good job on regulatory issues), and Piper Rudnick (bad 
experience).  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Matt, 

Our preference is to sign this before June 19.  I recall that Herman is out. 
Do you know when he will be back?

I will make sure that you and Herman get a copy of the next draft.  It won't 
be this week.

Hi Allyson,

What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has 
intervened in the CPCN proceeding?  Is this typical?  Does the AG's office 
(or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the 
confidential information we file?

Thanks,

Kay

I am scheduled to be out of the office Tues-Thurs of this week.  I will be in 
New York with Mark Bernstein negotiating a term sheet for the Co Op City 
deal.  This is one of the asset management deals I'm working on for the NE 
Power Team.  

I haven't confirmed with Mark that the trip is still on, so there is still 
the possibility that it might cancel.

Kay

Hi John,

Enron is ok with signing the consents.  After the assignment of the contracts 
out of LLCs, we would like to exercise our put.  Please share this info with 
George.  

I believe Ben will be in town tomorrow (right Ben?) so we can get it signed 
up this week.

Thanks,

Kay

Here is the contract information.  The contract group could not locate the 
CES-Devon contract so all I have is the info from TAGG and Sitara.

For the GTC and GISB contracts that have no paper, I wrote price and location 
on the EXCEL spreadsheat.

I got the info but wanted to know more about the preset programs.  The net 
advertisement shows 20 preset programs, but the info I received only shows 
4.  I also wanted to know what the display looked like.  The literature does 
not show what the display  looks like.  I have what the 9.2 looks like but it 
appears that the 9.6 is different.  Also how fast does this machine get to.  
This machine has a 10 year warrenty.  Who will service this in Texas and If 
for any reason treadmill by net ceases to exist, what are the conditions of 
my warrenty.

On the preset programs can I just say I want to run X distance whether it is 
a hill workout, time or what ever?

What is the maximum amount of time a workout can be programmed to?

Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?  If I wanted 20 
intervals in an interval workout is that possible?   If I wanted to run for 
an hour, does each segment have to be 6 minutes?

It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality 
flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well 
as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in 
ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your 
respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in 
the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your 
respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an 
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other 
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted 
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a 
presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between 
12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.

Jeff, can you spend a little time thinking about the current North American 
energy markets (very high energy prices, stretched infrastructure, etc) and 
determine which game changing or altering technologies, business models or 
existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility 
levels.

  In particular, I think that Miller should take a look at coal gasification 
technologies, emissions technologies and DSM/efficiency technologies and how 
these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business.  As well, 
from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie) 
IPP, E&P, utility, assets, etc are undervalued given current commodity curves 
and expectations.

Can you get back to me with a few ideas in the next week or so - maybe it 
would help to go pick a few brains in various ENA orgs as part of your 
process.

Regards
Delainey

Jeff Ader is looking for a reserved parking spot.  He is presently parking on 
the Blue level and would like to have a reserved spot due to his frequent 
traveling and customer appointments that warrant his leaving the building, 
thus loosing his parking space. 

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your 
capabilities better than ours.  

In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, 
part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric 
contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW 
of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all 
their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP 
controls in the nation.

The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him 
yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is 
a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like 
the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good 
lead into the health care segment.

Delainey

Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up 
with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on 
Wednesday.  Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so 
that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".  I would also 
suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers.  
It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as 
Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties 
settlement offer.

I am in the office over the next several days. Lets discuss at your earliest 
convenience.

Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board 
meetings and PRC's.

Lets set up this discussion with the following points:
 a) we are not exiting Argentina;
 b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business 
opportunity;
 c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate 
intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater 
productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision 
making and greater communication;
 d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer 
coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and
 e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao 
Paulo.

Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and 
origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources 
based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs 
wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong 
presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural 
issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that 
you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina 
- its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business 
model we are trying to move forward.

Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these 
ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and 
Orlando as part of this process.

Regards
Delainey

Scott, I apologize that no one talked to you before this one went out.  I 
assumed that Marty or Dan had spoken to you as we discussed this initial 
change; however, I take full responsibility.  I will guarantee it won't 
happen again.  My understanding is that you have been a significant 
contributor to EES strategy and success.  You can count on a lot more 
discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you 
will be leading a market opportunity.  I have asked Kay to set up some time 
for us to discuss the market and the future next week.  If that is not soon 
enough, I am around all day today.

Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we 
managed the position in a very effective manner.

Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a 
necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, 
should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors 
on these boards?

Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti 
is putting plan in place.

Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's 
review and then detailed review with each team.

This workbook has a number of worksheets including:
 a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we 
own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC;
 b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay 
expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be 
offset by larger monetizations;
 c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external 
capital charges are added back to reach EBIT;
 d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget;
 e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT 
non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups 
and bonus/other comp;
 f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 
assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond;
 g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, 
assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then 
calculates a net capital and depreciation charge;
 h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no 
anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant 
investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are 
charged @ a blended rate of 9%.

Two action items:
 a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his 
comment and review &
 b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for 
distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of 
weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet 
(including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), 
leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.  I would 
like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you 
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, 
our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.  

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) 
at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a 
success.


Sincerely,


Dave

Steve, I appreciate the offer - I  hope you didn't have to promise your first 
born since I was basically giving you a hard time.  I may take you up on this 
next season.  Regardless, I appreciate all the good work you and your team 
are doing.

I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our 
settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of 
communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I 
have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the 
larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm 
pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have 
suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both 
TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are 
going.  

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.

Regards
Dave Delainey

David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH.  
Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the 
reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant 
recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and 
infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given 
the possible recovery of this sector?  

The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy 
prices.

Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?

Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want 
to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring. 

Regards
Delainey

Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your 
thoughts on your current role.  I have heard you are considering global fuels 
and Lagrasta's business.  I would like to give you my perspective on the 
future vision for power and the overall organization including gas 
mid-market.  

Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to 
manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself 
the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the 
primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years.

Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience.

Regards
Delainey

Rick, we have re-examined the portfolio as a result of our last meeting and 
have an expected portfolio of $500M (gross) or $408M (net-ENA's share) to be 
placed into Raptor on September 1.  We have a second tranche of $608M (gross) 
or $396M (net ENA's share) to be placed into Raptor 2 on December 1.  

Kafus, Ecogas, Brigham, Crown Energy and Merlin CLO Equity Option will not be 
part of either Raptor 1 or Raptor 2.

Please confirm that this is consistent with you view of capacity and timing.

Jim, I have forwarded your binder to David Oxley to set up a meeting for the 
wholesale group to discuss appropriate homes for your people.  It has taken a 
little longer than expected to get people together but we are making 
progress.  It may be helpful for you to identify, like Abe, where these folks 
would like to go if they had their druthers.

It may be worthwhile for us to have a quick phone call to discuss.

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

Regards
Delainey

Eric, as per our discussion, I would suggest that we have no quotes or 
comments in the press release.  As a sale of assets, which we do actively, in 
a our network strategy there is really nothing positive that can be said 
without reflecting poorly on the buyer.  I would suggest that we approve an 
AEP press release as we did with Allegheny.  If we have not already, I would 
not send the attached press release to AEP without cutting out the quote.

Delainey

Kay please forward to Max Yzaguirre.

Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 
MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

Regards
Delainey

Guys, Swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market 
group in east power and make a difference.  I would strongly support his 
movement into either SERC or ECAR as per our earlier discussion.  

I hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power 
mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in 
those markets.  I would also hope to move a reasonable number of new 
associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various 
desks.  The goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and 
mid-market groups plus support John's iniatives on the fundamental groups.

Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not 
execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to 
operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute 
the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential 
buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have 
been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.

All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities 
(including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) 
will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.

Beth, can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite.  You 
have approximately one hour.  Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan 
(ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe 
your view of where we need to go in the future.  I would leave some time for 
questions.

The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good 
understanding of what is our systems agenda for ENA in 2001.

Could you have a first cut by December 8th?

Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting.

Paul, thanks for the note.  Please clarify the following for me:  break out 
2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the 
ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al.

Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams

Guys, attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot 
List for each business unit.  The performance of your group is key to making 
our targets for Q4 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the 
year.  Independent of specific budgets for the groups, the origination 
organization needs to generate $250M for Q4.  Ultimately, a strong 
performance in Q4 by the origination organization will help build momentum 
into the year-end PRC. 

I will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and 
specifics on the deals.

Delainey

Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I 
think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going 
concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses 
that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the 
cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than 
the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often 
clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly 
effectively.

Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of 
time on this.

Guys, Wes is going to come talk to you about booking more value in Mariner in 
order to meet Global Finance and ENA targets.  I want a view from you guys of 
what is the prudent carry value for Mariner assuming current gas prices and 
the reserve increases assumed to coming.  Keep in mind what would be a 
reasonble sale value for the asset mid-next year as per our plan.

Delainey

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks 
into his central Technical Services group.  These folks would continue to 
work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the 
centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors 
including NEPCO and OEC.  It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican 
business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development 
risk.  Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.

I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this 
memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.


As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

Wes, I noticed that Laura Scott is not on the list for non-commercial VP 
candidate but Georgiana and Sherman were - did you change your mind?

I think you have until the 4th to put up your candidates.

Jim,

I really appreciate the offer.  Sorry for the delay in responding - things 
have been a little crazy.  I would like to accept the tickets for myself.  
Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is 
interested.  I will give you a call a little later in the day when things 
settle down.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Homer,

I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able 
to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the 
gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I.T. is looking into this 
issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can 
save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to 
Email.

Thank you,

Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the 
others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for 
everyone.  They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and 
Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.

Thanks -- I know it's a pain,

Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.  This was an EOL deal that 
Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.  Deal QF9221.1 was booked in 
Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.  Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 
was not killed when we booked the new deal.  Please call me with any

John,

Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a 
good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get 
her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers 
tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but 
she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital 
and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the 
NG Price book.  These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are 
positive value to the book.

A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000).  
The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.  We are 
awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.

Sharon,

I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with 
the exception of two deals.  Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change 
an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.  We 
will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them 
from the Structuring group.

The NG price curve, outside of the first 36 months, is set based on market 
quotes and daily activity, as well as trend calculations and differentials.

I will let you know as soon as I have the confirms for the other two deal.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Frank,

I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I 
alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date.  
This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still 
working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.

Thanks,

In the Position folder.  I saved a file called 'GammaFile'.  The worksheet we

I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate 
Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not 
officialized).  Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put 
together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every 
book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these 
problems can be fixed before the morning.

The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.

Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,

Errol L. McLaughlin

These deals were killed because we have terminated all deals with BP CAPITAL, 
T BOONE PICKENS, and PICKENS FUEL CORP.  Since there were so many deals we 
did not put comments in the deals.  However, deal tickets have been provided 
explicitely explaining what the Middle Market Group is doing w/ these 
companies.

Jeff,

Derek stopped by after he talked to his wife over the phone and it looks like 
he will probably take the job.  He wants to talk to her again tonite, and he 
will let me know officially tommorrow.  So he can let Joe Hunter know -- any 
idea on when they'll want him to start?

Yes this is correct.  This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out 
deals everyday.  EOL is only booking them to one leg.

Bob,

I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and 
options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be 
the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book 
administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should 
correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary 
worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel 
free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.




Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

These annuities were paid to the counterparty after several deals we had with 
them were restructured.  George Gilbert (the originator responsible) has 
already confirmed the deals with the counterparty.

Agustin,

Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is 
selling leg 1.  I can't remember.  Did you say that we have already received 
a check back from the counterparty?  Let me know, b/c this deal has price and 
basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.

Thanks,

Jeff,

For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who 
accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps.  
The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.  In 
addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and 
credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that 
needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.  John would let 
them change those deals too.

On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in 
late November to NYMEX swaps.  Because of the timing there was a P/L impact 
of -$1.3MM.  When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, 
and he stated that what they click on is what they get.  I relayed this to 
settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and 
Utilicorp are 'upset'.  They claim that they have John and Mike on tape 
letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps.

We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.  We book two new legs that 
create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal.

Vikas,

Attached are excel files for the different subsidiaries.  Each file has a tab 
for the swap position and the option position.  For the options I have added 
an auto filter at the top of the file so you can sort by strike price.  I 
apologize for the delay, but I was trying to drop the info into an 
appropriate format.

We now have a PG&E topock basis product on EOL.  The curve is currenlty 
mapped to Socal with the differential to Socal being calculated in the 
physical index curve.  Let's work on setting up this curve on Tuesday so that 
it shows the accurate value for fin deals.  We can have the curve calc off of 
a discount to citygate in Keith's spreadsheet.

Please write up a ticket transferring my CIG and WIC April physical positions 
to IM denver.  I will be selling CIG index to Jay at CIG index flat and 
buying the 2000/d at CIG index minus .03.  Also, run a report of all my term 
index positions at CIG and WIC for the summer, so that we can transfer these 
to Jay as well.

Thanks,

Dale,  

Will you please create the following products for me when you get the 
chance?  I would like to have GD/D HHUB vs EP San Juan,  GD/D HHUB vs. EP 
Permian, GD/D HHUB vs. Malin, and  GD/D HHUB vs. Kern/Opal.  These will look 
like the GD/D HHUB vs. SCal that we currently have in EOL.

Also, Can I please create three Gas Daily basis products. GD/D BAJA spread - 
This spread will simply be the GD/D SCAL vs. PG&E Citygate. 
The GD/D Redwood off-system spread - GD/D Malin vs. SCal.  The GD/D Redwood 
on-system spread -   GD/D Malin vs. PG&E Citygate.

Call me to discuss.  Thank you.

You all have done an excellent job with the gas daily products.  I have been 
asked to follow up with you guys to ensure that the products are rolled out 
on EOL at the same time each day and that they be managed in the same manner 
that you manage your cash products each day.  We have been asked to have one 
a day up at all times with a relatively tight two way and to provide market 
depth.  You may provide market depth, offset to last trade, or use last trade 
mid functions.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding 
this request.

Thanks,
Mike

Thank you for contacting me.  The new baby is doing great.  I would like to 
add you guys to the box if you are interested.  I would also like to have 
your west physical guys on my box.  It has been brought to my attention that 
APB has great fixed price physical flow.  If you are not aware, I am running 
the physical desk as well.  Let everyone know that it will based on one 
condition - All numbers or no numbers.  We do not wish to participate in a

I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  

Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the 
laptop share the printer (which is connected to my desktop)?  Do I use 
Network Neighborhood?

Please set up the Souther border, PG&E and Southern Border, Socal inices in

it.  Also, please acitvate long term index products of one year.  There is 
also a PG&E topock phys product in the one month category for april that 
needs to be activated.  

I look forward to hearing from you Monday morning.

Anne,

Can we add PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock index points to the NCD locations?  
I think we discussed that they can't be added because of their association 
with Socal curves.  Let me know.

Also, can we add the new rockies index locations to the NCD sheet?  It would 
be nice to see these locations broken out in detail.

Ina, I can't seem to find the expense deposit for the SW Bell charges in my 
account.  Will you please contact them again and ask them for a copy of the 
check?  Thank you so much.

We need to make certain that the transport  for Pasdena is booked properly in 
sitara.  I am taking a flash to actual hit on P&L because of our inability to 
book this deal properly.  I need the transport booked in sitara at index to 
index, and then book the fixed cost payed to Pasadena in an index minus sale 
to them at the border.  Please run a minibook of the transaction thru the 
remaining term and let me review it.  Please let me know when this has been 
fixed.  

Kim, what is the cost of the transport for the month of May?  Did we roll the 
cost from April?  Also, did we change the index in the San Juan to Inside 
Ferc?


Thanks, 

Mike

Mark,  

Please describe in detail, the downstream capacity available to transport 
this gas.  How does the CIG capacity being sold to Coastal impact this 
point?  If you can make the case for this gas flowing without constraint, 
then I see no problem in making a fixed price bid for the full volume.

A rough sketch of the gas location and its downstream flow options would be 
nice. 

Thanks,

Mike

Dear Tom, 

Enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to 
discuss listing other index points at the Socal border.  I think the market 
requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with 
respect to transportation constraints.  The market has clearly seen a 
divergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects.  The 
marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has 
proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting 
daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas 
during these months.  Because of this, supply being transported from the 
Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E.  This places 
downward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock 
gas.  Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to 
the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's 
interconnects.  Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.   

There is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of 
liquidity.  Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport 
contracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets. 
The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg.  The overwhelming 
demand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock.  Although Ehrenberg is the 
marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream 
capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at 
Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg.  The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf 
of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.  Ehrenberg 
simply gets placed at "market prices" because of varying objectives.  One 
transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller 
buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies.  This 
illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg. 

Picture  the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha 
basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.  Because 
of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on 
EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first.  These 
molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise, 
all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery 
interconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on 
the SJ east leg of EPNG.  This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas 
going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on 
the EPNG south mainline.  While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does 
the EOC demand.  Permian west (Keystone West meter)  cannot satisfy both the 
EOC demand and the Socal demand.  So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG 
Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south 
mainline.  This tells the entire story.  When demand exceeds all available 
historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg 
demand, you have a paradigm shift.   This eliminates any correlation that may 
have existed between the supply basins and the market area.  When Keystone 
West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the 
max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.  There is simply no available 
capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate 
transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.  If you asked the market what the 
maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not 
know.  This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are 
above historical levels.  It is like Al Gore blaming "big oil companies" for 
the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity.  There 
simply isn't the capacity to meet demand.  The supply exists, but there isn't 
enough refining capacity available to meet demand.  Fundamentals rule the 
market in all cases.

I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern 
California border.  The market would  be better served with supply being 
included in these index points.  One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG 
Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge.  The market 
will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in 
the future.  We will then address the different interconnects and propose an 
index for the Socal citygate as well. 

Call me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download.

Sincerely,

Matt, your new responsibility for 7:30 meeting will be to go over all gen 
outages in the west by region and fuel type, and to discuss the previous days 
gen numbers and load forecasts.  Including pricing info and heat rates from 
the Portland guys and/or Megawatt Daily will also help.  Effective on 
Thursday.

I received an email this morning regarding the reports viewer.  I agree with 
restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with 
removing myself from those allowed to review positions.  I not only run one 
of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West 
physical book.  Phillip Allen passed on the IM WEST physical book to me two 
months ago.  While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am 
managing all physical positions.

Thanks. It looks like the phys transport volumes were added to socal and 
citygate, but could you add all of the transport model positions to the 
physindex tab.  PG&E topock, san juan, mojave, krs, etc.

Gracias,
Mike

Thank you for the summary.  Where can we find a detailed summary of the gas 
cost mechanism?  Are we confident that it is an average of all border points 
into CA?  If the real time price is capped at the least efficient generator, 
then what happens if this genertor can only buy Socal daily gas?  This 
avergae CA gas price will lead to a tighter heat rate for the generators, 
since the spread between Malin and Socal has reached $7.00 at times.

Thank you,
Mike Grigsby

Please make certain that all physical positions are loaded correctly in NCD 
for term.  Have Patti Sullivan load all transport from the transport model in 
sitara so that the physical index positions will be recognized in NCD.   This 
would include SJ/Perm to Socal through OCT, Baja through MAR 20001 (100,000/d 
short PG&E Topock, 20,000/d long KRS, and 80,0000/d long Citygate), Kingsgate 
to Malin(Barry), Steve South's latest transport deal from Kingsgate/Stanfield 
to Malin, and any SJ to Waha transport.  

Anne, did you get a ticket from Steve on the transport mentioned above?  
King/Stan to Malin.

Also, let me know what the status of the transport deal from Kingsagte to 
Malin with Barry.  

Is the gd index for Perm position loading correctly in NCD for Apr-Oct?

Mo, please carry out the physical positions in NCD through Mar 2001. 

Thanks!

Anne,

After NX1 going forward, I would like to load my final positions in the 
LIQBasis tab in NCD.  The positions will include basis, physindex and gd 
index positions.  We can then run settlement index scenarios to see what my 
risk will be to index postings.  This will be a huge benefit.

Rockies, and remian neutral on Permian and San Juan, unless it looks like the

We will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow 
constraints on EPNG.  The currrent capacity cuts in the SJ and Socal topock 
delivery points are 50%.  I would like my P&L to show this risk.  Please find 
a way to adjust the positions according to a daily flow curve that can be set 
in newcurrentday by either myself or Monique.  

Also, We will need to set up a new physical curve for Mojave Topock.  Our 
transport is currently being reallocated by EPNG for deliveries to Mojave 
instead of Socal topock.  I would like to show the transport on EPNG value as 
SJ plus cost to Mojave and have the value roll out each month, if any.  The 
risk is showing the value of SJ to Socal topock (currently wide spreads for 
2001) on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to Mojave 
topock.

Sincerely,
Mike

I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need 
to discuss this in more detail.  I would like to continue to use the physical 
for large prompt positions going forward.  I am afraid that the baseload 
volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.  
We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.  i.e. Intra 
regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then 
booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.  Janie managing SJ and 
laying off risk on Steve's Opal.  I know that the cash books would be a good 
idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the 
cash risk for baseload as well.  What are your thoughts?

I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.  Matt Smith and Susan Scott 
to analyst,  Jay to the ROX, etc.  It seems like Ken S. has shown more 
interest in the west fundies lately.  Should we keep his services?

The basis products need another book.  Who can we add to the mix?  I think 
that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.  He has a 
great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing 
tight two ways for all products on the prompt.  Keith can do term with 
another book.

Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.  I will 
continue to manage the CA products.  This should allow us to provide tighter 
two ways across the west. I will continue to manage all index products and 
prompt month phys fixed price.

Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.  
The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to 
nom the market.

EOL.  Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that 
you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.  We should 
propose this to EOL.  This would allow for tighter markets on all products 
and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.

Ca cash products.  Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal 
physical products.  I would like to have PG&E topock and Socal Ehrenberg 
before the summer.

Good morning.  With the energy crisis in California at this time, we will 
need to be extra careful with nominations at Socal and throughout the west to 
ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we 
have been providing to our customers.  You guys are doing an excellent job 
and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited 
staff.  Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of  pipeline 
allocations 12 hours in advance.  We all know that this can be almost 
impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the 
basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with 
an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential 
penalties.  We also need to document when the call was made.  In regards to 
the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be 
requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our 
counterparties.  Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take 
place at these historical levels.  We need to remember that our 
counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price 
implications on their P&L.  We should not rely on prior business conduct in 
regards to "standard epng allocations" when dealing with our customers.  I 
would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be 
above the "pipeline average".

Let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our 
control.  How do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations 
that we can't see?  Are there package numbers on each baseload contract to 
ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price? Let me know 
which companies are not providing Enron with timely allocation reports at 
Socal and I will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational 
information sooner.

Sincerely,

Mike

I would like to check the index positions in the physindex tab in NCD.

to add a KRS row in the physindex summary to account for the 20000/d 
transport that we have.  Also, please have the new transport index positions 
at Socal that we are booking tomorrow included in the new KRS column in the 
physindex tab.  We can review in the afternoon.

You are doing a great job.  I am sorry that I have not had a chance to thank 
you recently.  The market is distracting me.

Sincerely,
Mike

Barry,

I would like to focus our deal flow on Apr-Oct or 1 yr San Juan and Rockies 
supply.  Our fundamental investment is mainly in the rockies for 2001.  Let's 
get together with Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci, and others to set our supply goals 
for the mainly the apr-oct period.  I would like to work on buying every 
mmbtu of Opal, and all points included in the IF NW Rockies index.  Our goal 
should be to purchase at least 400,000/d of rockies supply and 500,000/d of 
San Juan Blanco and Bondad.  we have been buying these phys index points at 
+.01 in the rockies and +.005 in the San Juan.  You may need to coordinate 
with Fred Lagrosta's group initially to get all of their producer contacts.

Thanks,
Mike

Fixing the PG&E topock curve to Socal less .25 would only allocate more 
positive income to the transport.  The position at topock is short.  I am not 
sure if this is the problem from Friday.  Let's get together in the morning.  
Thanks for the email.

Mike

Greg,

Are you interested in discussing opportunities with E*steel at another 
time?   I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up an appointment in 
the near future.  Let me know what your objective is with Enron Networks, and 
if you are pursuing the same online platform growth in steel that we are in 
natural gas.  Do you see opportunities in trading steel products as a 
commodity at some point, and if so, will Enron be active in making markets 
not only on EOL, but on other platforms?  

I appreciate your taking the time to entertain their questions.  Thank you 
for your assistance.

sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Dear Tom,

I am glad you like the website.  When you go into the personalize myquotes 
filter, select the commodity, region, and products.  You will need to scroll 
down the products list and select the US GAS phys index points of interest to 
you.  Please call me if you have any problems.  Your filter can then be 
sorted by right clicking on the filter at the column heading.  You can sort 
by five different groupings.  

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Are we confident that the gda priced positions are not being represented in 
my newcurrentday position sheet?  I know that Phillips triggered their 
volumes back to GDA equivalent and that Matt Lenhart bought some GDA malin 
gas.  How do we keep these from showing up in the physical risk?

The proxy price will be Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald for Ca deliveries.  
How do we submit prices to Cantor Fitzgerald?  Anne, we will need to come up 
with  a cash report, much like our monthly index report for the 
publications.  Our data submitted will be under scrutiny at some point in the 
future.  It is important that all of our cash (one day) deals are reported

My suggestion for improving the process within the risk group is to do a 
better job of verifying all term deals are coming to the cash desk at mid.

I believe a large improvement can be made in the settlements area.  The forms 
are not accurate, the entire support is not attached and the form they are 
usign does not properly divide the variance between the three possible areas 
causing a variance, desk price, UA4, firm volumes.

Sorry it has taken so long to get the scores out.  After 4 days in Vegas, 
please check your scores - I am still in a daze.  Kansas - please forward 
attachment to your friend Kris, Denver forward to Josh Stevens and John 
Swinney please forward to Rob Fullen.  Here are the list of people I still 
need money from:
Josh Stevens
Denver Plachy
Jimmy Simien
Eric Bass
Flannigan
Jason Wolfe

Money must be to me by COB Wednesday or your entry is forfeited(if your score 
is bad and you do not pay I will not put you in any pool in the future).

Right now the pot is $410(assuming everyone pays) so the break down is 
$307.50 and $102.50 for first and second respectively.  

The following people need to give me a tiebreaker number for the final game 
by COB Today(total score for final game):
Jason Wolfe
Denver Plachy
Scott Earnest
Chad South
Doug Friedman
John Nowlan
Lee Jackson
John Swinney
Rob Fullen
Josh Stevens

If I do not get a tiebreaker from you and you tie for first, you will 
automatically get second and if you tie for second you are out of the money.  

Again, please verify your score and let me know of any discrepancies - 1 pt. 
first round victory, 2 pts. second round victory and upset gets seed 
differential.

Thanks everyone for playing.

Yes, I did get in touch with him.  Thanks again for the info.  He is just 
being a beach bum...not really doing anything.  Guess I should have figured 
that.

Per Laura's request, we have modified the orig schedule for Central.  I have 
attached the revised schedule.  Please note the following changes - on the 
1st tab - orig schedule, we added a column for deal value before origination 
was granted.  We will populate this field for all new deals as of yesterday.  
The other changes are the second tab.  The second tab provides a summary by 
originator of the total deals originated and total value originated.  We will 
update both schedules in the future for all deals originated whether value 
was originated or not.  We will then email this schedule to the three of you 
every time the schedule changes.  If you would prefer a hard copy, please let 
me know.

If there are any other changes or modifications you would like to see, please 
let me know.  Thanks.

Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.  All of the sub books 
associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e. Price, Basis, Index and

FYI - 
wanted to let you guys know about a few things:
1.  There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine - 
it is a little black date book.  Please put any future requests in there so 
that we can keep track of who needs off when.  I would like to try and keep 
from having more than 3 people out at a time.
2.  Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.  
These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly 
swaps.  This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader 
at gas daily as opposed to mid.  This is very important to avoid OA variances.
3.  When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are 
created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.  This is 
important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I 
notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct 
gd curve.
4.  I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the 
process and how to prepare forms.
5.  Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.  All 
the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to 
spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the 
positions that they do.  The only request I have had is that we sit there 
quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.  Please utilize this 
opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for 
career development.
6. I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your 
training plans.

Please shout with any questions.

Just wanted to let you know that we are having global counterparties in 
Houston inactivate the spot contract we have with Sunoco Inc so that anyone 
that tries to book a deal to this entity wil have to get a contract in place 
or get this one reactivated.  This difficulty should send up a red flag and 
keep deals from flowing with this counterparty.  Please let me know if you 
need any further information.  Thanks.

I have put all of the liquidations for GD Central in the Fred Liquidations 
file.  There is a variance of ($13,950) on the gas daily between what we 
flashed and what detail we now have.  We will have to take this adjustment to 
the P&L(wil be expense).  I do not have detail for Basis Capacity Hedges or 
LT Transport.  I am under the impression that these numbers are given to you 
each month by Cernosek's group.  For Basis Capacity Hedges, we flashed 
($31,074) and for LT Transport we flashed ($130,735).  The detail in this 
file plus these three numbers should tie out.  If not, please let me know.  
Shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.

FYI, Sally is getting an ear full today from the RAC group about 
unofficialized post id's.  We run a macro every night to verify these are 
officialized.  I just want to remind everyone that this is very important 
that we do this.  Our group and Jeff will catch tremendous heat if these 
errors continue.  Again, this is just a reminder, we are doing a good job on 
this currently.  Thanks.

I do not mind us bringing JAckson.  I understand your desire to be with him 
all the time, but I would like to occasionally do something with our friends 
for a vacation that is just us.  I think in time you will become more 
comfortable, and I will just wait for that time.

You need to talk to your mom and decide if we are going this weekend.  If we 
go we need to make plans for barkley.

Bundle Jackson up this morning it is near freezing.  Please cover the plants 
out back.  Thanks.

Thanks anyway.  I have some information that Darron kept on Cilco, I am still 
having trouble finding any deals for 98 that can show me we definitely did or 
did not flash these deals wrong.  I am going to keep working on it.

So am I.  I heard through the grapevine that we will be heading out to 
Ditka's for your birthday on Thursday?  I also heard rumors that they may be 
closing that casino down.  I hope it is not before Jazz Fest.

Did you not hear me.  I said I was talking athletics.  Do you want me to 
break out academics with you?  I will be more than happy to discuss Auburn.  
Top 15 schools for your money, US News & World Report.   Behind the service 
academies, more astronauts than any other university.  Top ten among 
universities in terms of fortune 500 CEO's, Fortune Magazine.  

The point, don't try and act like LSU is the best school in the land.  Just 
because Enron doesn't recruit at some schools, doesn't mean they are inferior 
academically.  I would much rather have a degree from Tulane than LSU or 
Auburn, in terms of academic stature.  You should know that recruiting at 
Enron has and will always be political.  You have to have someone from that 
school in upper managment request trips be made.  I can promise you in the 
next 2-3 years they will be recruiting at Auburn.  I and anothe alum have 
already discussed it with HR.

Just wanted to give you guys a reminder when it comes to new deals out of our 
traders notebooks.  Please check each morning when you copy the new deals for 
the current day that you verify the prior day's last deal was entered.  It is 
very easy to miss a deal the trader does after four and the trader's do not 
always remind us that they did a deal late.  I spoke with hunter this morning 
and he wants these mistakes to stop.  This doesn't happen often, put it is 
very easy to miss these types of deals in the future.  Thanks for your help.

I got the form from John with a note on it about lone liquidations.  This 
relates to a physical deal and I thought we went over the specifics 
yesterday.  This relates to 309136 for jan and 594576 for the remainder.  
This is a structured deal with John Griffith and we were unwinding a previous 
deal for 1/01-12/01, the remaining original term stayed intact.  It appears 
you are missing some liquidations that would remove this variance.  They are 
E00982.4 &.5.  

Please let me know if you have any more questions, this deal is a real pain 
in the butt.

I am curious why N70012.Q is a variance in 0001 and N70012.R is not a 
variance in 0008.  If you look in the two fred files, 0001 has the liq 
flashed and not in the GL, and in 0008 the liquidation is in flash and the 
GL.  The counterparties in both are the same.  Jim needs to revise 0001 
file.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.

Great article on what it truly means to be an Auburn Man




The ties that bind 
Friday night meetings have helped Auburn through hard times
10/03/00
By PHILLIP MARSHALL 
Times Sports Staff 


AUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.

Five straight games had been lost. Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as 
head coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years 
of trouble, despair and losing.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
''It was defense and offense,'' offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said. 
''Whatever happened, we pointed fingers at each other.''
On the Friday night before last November's game against Central Florida, a 
small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback 
Heath Evans. They prayed. They talked about life and the sometimes bitter 
turns it can take.

A bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters 
and reserves. It wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about 
football. It was about matters of the heart.

''We may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,'' senior whip 
linebacker Rob Pate said. ''Since then, it's just like another thing on the 
itinerary. It's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there. 
We've got five or six coaches. Coach Tuberville comes in there. People just 
lay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds.''

Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November 
night. Players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has 
grown ever stronger.

It has carried the 15th-ranked Tigers to a 5-0 record going into Saturday's 
Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at 20th-ranked Mississippi 
State.

Pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in 
the most difficult times.

Pate knows about pain and even fear. A mysterious disease, now seemingly 
under control, threatened his senior season.

''When you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you 
for help, you know everything about a guy,'' Pate said. ''With me, it was my 
health. Before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and 
every guy in there put his hands on me. We said a prayer together. Man, I was 
crying.

''It's like that every weekend. Somebody on this team is suffering through 
something. They share it. When you line up on Saturday, it's a lot easier to 
look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got.''

On the field, there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season. 
Tuberville says it started when Auburn players, strengthened by the bad 
times, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for 
their teammates and their school.

''I've never been around a team this close,'' Tuberville said. ''They get 
along. We haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys 
urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to 
get better.

''It's just a special group. They enjoy being around each other and 
understand what it's going to take for us to win.''

The change from not so long ago is striking, Simmons says.

''If you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little 
group, things aren't going to work,'' Simmons said. ''If you have trust in 
your teammates, you can build a good team. Right now, we've got that going.''

It starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college 
football. They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in 1997. Then 
came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, Terry Bowden.

They revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting. They 
take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.

No one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback Ben Leard. He 
went from starter to third team in 1998, then won his job back in 1999 when 
hardly anyone thought he could.

Today, he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback.

''We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say 
'Man, I'm looking forward to playing in the NFL,' '' Leard said. ''No one is 
worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise. 
Everybody just wants to win ball games. The relationships we have on this 
team are like brothers.''

Leard says nothing that happens can change that.

''If we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special 
seasons I've ever had in my life,'' Leard said. ''We've got people excited. 
We're excited. The fun is back in it for us.

''It's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to 
practice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk. There are no fingers being 
pointed anywhere. There are no individuals on this football team.''

Evans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of 
blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson. Every Friday night, Evans is still the one 
who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain.

''Heath is just like that all the time,'' Pate said. ''He's a great example 
of somebody who lives what he talks. He's a role model, not just for younger 
people but for all of us.''

His name was Keith Corbo.  He graduated with us and went to Texas A&M.  He 
was is a fraternity Beta Theta Pi.  He dropped out and moved to Florida and 
worked at a bar(his dad had moved their).  The last time I talked to him was 
when he was in Florida in 1992 or 1993.  I can not find him anywhere.  He 
would definitely be in our senior year book.

I will try and put something out there today and I will get some pictures to 
send as well.

Glenda,
Hope everything is going well for you guys.  I just wanted to take a minute 
and thank you for the easter  gift you sent Jackson.  It was very 
thoughtful.  He has enjoyed coloring the book and everything else he can get 
his hands on.  He also ate all of the chocolate as fast as he could.  He is 
getting really big and really independent.  We are headed to Jazz fest this 
weekend in New Orleans, I am sure he will really enjoy it this year.  Take 
care and we will talk to you soon.  Thanks again.
Love,
Jackson, Ashley & Phillip

Peter,

I learned yesterday for the first time about Project Canary, which involves 
the purchase of an asset that employs 400 employees and also has a unionized 
workforce.  I understand that we are in the second round, and that there is a 
deadline of 12/15.

Peter, we have discussed on numerous occasions the need for you to get me 
involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues.  
You haven't involved me in this deal -- I learned about the fact that there 
are employees and unions from my clients in HR.  That makes me and the legal 
department look bad and also does not allow me to provide the best service 
for Enron.

Please provide me with information about this deal asap.  And, I repeat my 
request to get me involved earlier on future deals.

Thank you.

Michelle

Cathy,

Also, for persons over 40 who are signing waivers, we must provide them with 
the census data about persons under 40/over 40 who were offered a package, as 
well as their title and age.  Please make sure that happens, or our waivers 
will not be valid.

Thanks.

Twanda, please take the text of this email and turn it into a document that 
is presentable so that I can give it to Mark at our Quarterly Business Review 
Meeting at 2:00 Monday -- actually, I will need it by noon so that I can 
revise it.  Thanks.  Michelle



Transactions

Major Events of September - November 2000

Garden State Paper -- closing and transition.

Triple Lutz -- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal 
discussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on 
both PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer's representatives, and 
discussions with clients.  Issues include salaries of employees hired by 
buyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees 
(including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for 
divesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.

Crane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.

Falcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.

E2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.


Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

Triple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition 
issues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by 
persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not 
to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.

East Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many 
transition issues due to Enron's providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP 
personnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services, 
including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.

Crane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor 
unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.


Litigation

Major Events of September - November 2000

No employee-initiated litigation for 2000.

Non-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in 
Sharolyn Wood's court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.

Minor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement 
fee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered 
mediation to follow.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, 
as people leave after they are paid their bonuses.  

We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.



Documents Generated

Major Events of September - November 2000

New Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting 
Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work 
Description for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from 
outside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the 
agreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.  

Standard Agreements:

I prepared:

  ___ draft employment agreements.

 ___ draft consulting services agreements.

  ___ separation agreement and releases.

 ___ retention letter agreements.

The number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in 
trading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person 
in trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There 
are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our 
non-compete provisions. 

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of 
contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus 
pool.  

Investigations

Major Events of September - November 2000

Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I 
directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the 
company decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with 
Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of 
the consultants' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to 
employees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]

Texaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the 
Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent 
inappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation 
results led to termination of employment for cause.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated 
following PRC/bonus discussions. 


Training

Major Events of September - November 2000

 Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works 
employees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).  

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  

EIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials 
Group.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition 
of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.  

All of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated 
early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher 
training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went 
through the first round.

Pre-Hire Testing 

Major Events of September - November 2000

Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of 
screening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development 
groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested 
experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests 
will result in a successful employee.

Re-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of 
potential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under 
Beth Perlman. 

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John 
Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&A 
program.


Employee Relations/Terminations  

Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination 
issues -- approximately 10-15 per week (total).  No two situations are alike, 
and they require significant time.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

After PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.  The 
company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on 
a performance improvement plan.  Generally, I review those before they are 
put in place.  If they are not successful, then terminations are likely 
(probably early in the first half of 2001).  Those issues are time-consuming 
and full of risks.

Work for Portfolio Assets

Major Events of September - November 2000

Ecogas:  wind-down issues.

Mariner:  Change of Control Agreements.

CGAS:  harassment prevention training -- arranged for Littler, Mendelson to 
provide training for CGAS personnel.

East Coast Power:  Agreements, advice and counselling on various issues.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

CGAS:  Revising employment agreements for key personnel.

Mariner:  Employment agreement negotiation.


Conclusions


ENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of 
manager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has 
placed processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement 
of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of 
manager or above.  

Salaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).

Net Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000.  
I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be 
managed out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling 
and documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure 
that risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that 
group working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it 
may improve over time.

Contractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the 
work force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if 
contractors are allowed to stay on too long.

Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many 
employees in the "exempt" category who should be classified as "non-exempt."  
I have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will 
not be an easy fix.

EIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of 
talent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle 
diligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle 
the job.  

EGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other 
groups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make 
retention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to 
shorten the non-compete duration for this group.

As you know, we have another power plant project -- if I haven't forwarded 
information to you yet, I will be doing so in the next day or so.

The schedule is for preliminary diligence to be completed by 9/8; data room 
is open 9/6.  Attached to the email I will be sending you is a list of the 
current information we have here -- lots of documents are here.  Please 
review the data list and forward to me which ones you want copied, and I will 
coordinate that process.

The stock purchase agreement draft will be circulated next week.

Andrea, This looks good.

I have two nits:  First, the street value of our phone book is $1k, not $1.  
Also, "loosing" people should be "losing" people.

One other risk is that the descriptions of what people are doing could reveal 
confidential business strategies to our competitors because there is no 
filter on what employees can/can't put.  In other words, if an employee is 
working on developing something within Enron that our competitors do not know 
about, expertfinder could provide them with that data/strategy.

One other recommendation (by Scott) was to allow access only from an Enron 
facility -- not remotely.  This would manage risk of a person taking a laptop 
to a competitor and also would protect against hackers.

Given that employee talent is a major asset, we should find ways to move that 
talent around while also protecting it from being picked off from the outside.

Thanks.

Michelle

Pat,

I am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement 
for Greg Whalley.  I would appreciate your thoughts on the language, 
particularly the language in amended section 2.1b regarding the calculation 
of value for options/restricted stock.  

For some reason, I cannot attach it to this email, so I will have my 
assistant send it under separate email cover.

Thanks a lot.

Michelle

Hello, everyone.

No need to work on Canary any more -- it is off.  I would suggest that you 
save your work in the event that it is revived, but it doesn't look like it 
is going to happen any time soon.

Brian,

Would you or someone in your group please investigate the allegations raised 
by Janeth Rodriguez-Philhower?  Based upon her voice mail message, there is a 
strong possibility of litigation.  Your investigation into her allegations 
thus would be conducted in anticipation of litigation.

Once you have conducted the investigation, please provide me with the results.

Thank you.

Michelle

Dee,

I left you a voice mail yesterday, but I wasn't sure if you were in.

There is a new deal -- Project E2/Endeavor.  It is in the preliminary stages, 
but the deal team (led by Don Miller) would like to have data regarding the 
average cost of Enron employee benefits, broken down by type of benefit, if 
possible.  I assume that you would have that type of data and could forward 
it to Don and me.

Let me know if I should be contacting someone else.

Thanks a lot!

Michelle

Drew,

At one point, we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among 
Corp. and the various business units that are using shared services.  I think 
that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we 
begin to move towards shared services across the organization.

Let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or 
revise agreements that currently are in existence (if there are none, then we 
really need to put some in place).

Thanks.

Michelle

Anne,

I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz.  From my perspective, it 
generally looks fine.  I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add 
any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.

In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.  I 
believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be 
identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds 
$250K.    We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the 
provisions of Section 4.13(iii).

Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not 
required by law.  However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the 
future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key 
personnel to stay with the company through closing.  This may be done with 
the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.  Section 6.2(e) contains 
a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.

In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any 
employment contracts.  We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, 
and the contracts of key personnel may expire.  Do we want to tie our hands 
and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?  Section 6.2(l) 
also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.

In Section 4.10, the wording "(other than Environmental Laws)" suggests that 
we are not in compliance with environmental laws.  Rephrasing that sentence 
to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.

In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind 
to customers.  I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host 
client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and 
provide Enron goodies to people all the time.  Perhaps a limitation on de 
minimus gifts would be more accurate.  Also, a reference to our Code of 
Ethics may work here.

In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, 
or does it include equity grants that vest over time?  A reference to "cash" 
payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock 
options/restricted stock that vest over time.

In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates 
vesting -- Pat, do you know?

Should Section 7.3 be italicized?  I have not seen the latest of the Employee 
Matters Agreement.

Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the 
purposes of dispute resolution?

Anne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any 
other questions.

Michelle

Yikes!!!!   I can understand your preoccupation with those issues out there.  
I am sure that you are all "talked out" about it, but if you need an 
empathetic ear, give me a buzz.  Talk to you later.

PS  I saw Julie Parraguirre last night, and she told me to say hello.  She is

Privileged and Confidential 
Attorney-Client Communication
This E-Mail Contains Legal Advice

In the Barbed Wire Purchase Agreement is the provision that the Purchaser has 
45 days to identify those employees of Company whom it would like the Company 
to terminate from employment prior to closing.  The Seller is providing a 
limited indemnity for Purchaser's actions in selecting those employees.  The 
indemnity expressly excludes claims against ENA for the selection of those 
employees.  This indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the 
basis of age, sex, race, religion, etc.  The indemnity exclusion also could 
be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference.

Thus, if ENA is going to exercise its right to select Company employees under 
that provision, ENA will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.  I 
can assist  you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and 
determining methods to manage the risks of those claims.

Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.

incorporated some, but not all, of your changes.  It is my hope that this 
draft is the final one; if it is not, I believe that it would be most 
efficient for you to meet with me and David Oxley before the end of this 
week, as I will be out of the office next week.  

Please let me or David know if you have any questions or comments.

Hector/Valeria,

Do we have a rule against heaters?  If not, that seems to be the easiest 
solution, as well as the "dress warm" advice.  I think that moving him would 
not be good -- his isolation could work against our goals here.

Your thoughts? 

Michelle

Dan,

I have been working with James McMillan on the LNG project in Venezuela.  I 
would like to have some additional information about structure, project 
company, etc., and figured you would know where I could obtain that 
information.  

Thanks.

Michelle

Hello!

An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.  There have been 
three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.  The topic is 
technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.  In this 4th 
edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own 
time.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously 
would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the 
book.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary 
information, however.

What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is 
willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not 
think that would be worthwhile.  My opinion at this point is that she can do 
it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of 
course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific  information.  I welcome 
your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.

Thanks for your thoughts.

Michelle

Hoyt,

Under the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, we must provide demographic 
information to persons over the age of 40 who are offered severance packages 
in exchange for a release.  We need the title/position and the age of the 
persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as 
well as the persons who were not offered a package.  We will provide this 
data to persons over 40 to validate their releases.

Thanks.

Michelle

I spoke with Corporate Compensation yesterday (Kim Bolton) about the option 
of paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the EIP 
incentive plan.   She is working on obtaining approval for that provision.

Otherwise, I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the 
plan.  Jeanne, could you please circulate one?

I'll be in San Antonio for the law conference the rest of the week, but this 
process should not wait for me.  Once corporate comp gives it the ok, we 
should be ready to finalize it.

Kerry,  What are your thoughts on this issue?

Michelle



Michelle,

We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime 
for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for 
assistance from you.  The problem we are having deals with employees who 
rotate shift.  Please review the following scenario.

For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the 
Night (N) shift.


  M T W Th F S

REG  8 8 8 8 8 
OT       8 
SHIFT  N N D D D D 


Interpretation 1

The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular 
rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    124.80  ((400+16)/40) x 1.5)


Interpretation 2

Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as 
follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    120.00 (400/40 x 1.5)

Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have 
totally missed the boat on both of them?

Thanks for your help,
Diane

Pat,

Thanks for your comments on the agreement.  As an FYI, the stock awards 
already have been made, so we had to soften the language in the agreement to 
address that situation.

I appreciate your other thoughts.  

Mary, could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an 
example as suggested by Pat?

Thanks.

Attached is a draft of the Agreement for Recruiting or Contract Personnel 
Services.  This draft combines the Master Services Agreement, the Agreement 
for Project Services, and the Staffing Services Agreement into a single, 
comprehensive document.

Attached to this, as applicable, will be a Project Work Description ("PWD") 
and/or a Staffing Services Description ("SSD").  I understand that HR is 
working on a revised PWD.

I will circulate the SSD in the near future.  It will contain a more specific 
description of staffing services (e.g. retained/contingency) as well as pay 
rates.

Please review this draft to determine if it fits your needs.  Feel free to 
throw darts!  Let me know by return email if you have comments or questions.  
I will resolve as many as possible based upon your comments as well as those 
of others in Legal, and circulate a revised draft based upon those comments.

Thank you.

Felicia,

Would you please run a disparate impact analysis for the proposed stock 
options to be granted within Enron Net Works?  I would like this data for the 
purpose of giving legal advice.

Thank you.

David,

As we discussed, Mark Haedicke and I discussed the possibility of providing 
Kevin McConville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he 
remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the NSM case and 
other litigation matters.

We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin.  The 
terms of that Agreement would include:

1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel 
regarding litigation matters.  He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare 
for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as 
needed.

2. Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this 
cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to 
the terms of his employment agreement).  After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a 
rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard.

3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary 
course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his 
employment with Enron.  Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or 
claims based upon the following:

  -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment, 
  -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA,
  -- Kevin's intentional acts, 
  -- Kevin's gross negligence,
  -- Kevin's reckless conduct,
  -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other 
legal obligation, or 
  -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act.

4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 
2/1/01.  The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt.  In addition, 
all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of  the 
agreement.

Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.  I 
am available to participate in your call with him, if you would like me to 
attend.

Michelle

Marty,

Gracie Presas is asking about training for ENA for harassment.  As we 
discussed, I think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to Enron 
global wholesale and ENW, to maximize efficiency.  So, I told her to call you.

The lawyer contact on this is Kerry Notestine at Littler Mendelson.  His 
number is 713-652-4748.  Thanks.

Just when you thought it was safe . . . 

I have received a question from NEPCO about Project 50.  Apparently, they 
have temporary employees who work on projects and then leave the company.  
These are hourly employees who do not work regularly.  Originally, these 
employees were thought to be included in the scope of Project 50 by corp.  
Mike Indivero called me and said that these people should not receive the 50 
options because they are not "regular, full-time or regular part-time 
employees" as described in the memo from the Office of the Chairman.

What are  your thoughts on that?  Should they be included or not? My reading 
of the email to all employees is that it does not include temporary 
employees.  Do you know how other temporary employees were treated?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks, as always.

Drew,

Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who 
has had some issues.  I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his 
agreement.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you 
fax it to my house first thing in the morning?  713-218-7355 is the fax 
number.  If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to 
review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I 
will prepare on this topic.  I am going to be attending a seminar out of the 
office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.

I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and 
Louise for comment and dart-throwing.  I can be reached via my cell phone 
during the day at 713-302-5522.

Thanks, Drew.

Andrea,

I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity.  
However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole 
concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our 
sessions.  It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of 
that meeting.  

I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business.  It looks like our 
action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an 
extension because of my travel).  In the meantime, you can meet with 
David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.

Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans 
without me.  (I am not sure how helpful I am in any event).  What do you 
think?  

Michelle

PS, do we need to include Don in our group?

Pete,

I learned today of a deal involving a newsprint plant in New Jersey, which 
you are running from the legal side.

Are there any issues involving personnel or labor involved in this deal?  If 
so, I would appreciate your getting me in the loop as early as possible.

Thanks.

Chuck,

Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?  Given the 
correspondence I've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we 
probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from 
the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled.  Otherwise, even if we do 
"agree" on dates, there likely would be additional delays.  I am ready to 
hear what this guy has to say about my client.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Roberto, If a person is accessing inappropriate web sites in the course of 
investigations, it does not violate the policies.  However, it may be useful 
to set up protocols or logs to confirm when a person is accessing it for 
investigative purposes to remove all confusion on the matter.  Michelle

California, then he needs a slightly different agreement because non-competes

Cheryl,

Thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in Houston.  I 
had a blast with you being here.

I hope that you didn't get sick -- I'd feel awful if you did.  I still have 
the sniffles, but managed to avoid the worst of it (so far).  Cameron perked 
right up after the antibiotics kicked in.   He is his usual self today 
(happily -- he was kind of a pest this weekend --  you really saw him at his 
worst, unfortunately).  We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on 
the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.

I hope you can manage the February trip and weren't frightened off by the 
rough time here last weekend.  When we're not sick, we're really much more 
fun!!  Besides, the pig races await.

gotta go.

Michelle

Trey, it looks like I may have to be in Portland for a mediation on July 27 
-- with travel on the 26th and the 28th.  Are you planning to be gone then, 
too?  If not, I'll schedule this trip (wanna join me with CAC and spend the 
weekend?).

I hope you are having fun and not working too hard.  Don't worry too much 
about me.  Gwyn is coming over to join us for dinner tonight, and Kay is 
dropping by tomorrow -- she offered to watch Cameron if I needed to do 
stuff.  I do miss you, though.

L, M

Twanda, would you please schedule a meeting with me, Hector, Sheila W., and

Privileged and Confidential

In our meeting on Friday, we talked about the summary of complaints that you 
three are going to do.  If possible, I would like to receive those by Tuesday 
night so that they can be reviewed on Wednesday.  We are meeting with 
Beck/Olson on Thursday.

Let me know if that is impossible -- I know you all are swamped with zillions 
of other things!

Thanks.

Michelle

Mark,

As you requested, below is a list of my major accomplishments for the year.  

1. Resolution/management of pre-litigation and litigation matters, 
including:  Dwayne Hart/Utilicorp; Satterwhite; Barrington; Race/Statoil; 
Ross Malme; Rick Blandford; West Boettcher; Anita Suson; Charlie Weymms; 
Steven Cuneo; others.

2.  Efficient management of drafting, negotiating, revising, and completing 
several types of contracts in numerous different jurisdictions (e.g., almost 
200 employment agreements, 35 separation agreements, and 30 consulting 
services agreements).

3. Lead attorney on Project One (which involves issues surrounding the 
OFCCP's "glass ceiling" audit of ENA and all of Enron).

4. Labor and employment transactional support, including:  East Coast Power, 
Ecogas, CGas, Project Hurricane, Columbia, Project Grizzly, Las Vegas Cogen, 
and other acquisitions that involve the transfer or hiring of personnel. Many 
of these transactions require extensive legal support relating to personnel 
matters after closing.

5. Legal support on labor (union) matters, including successful closing of 
project labor agreements for the construction of generation assets (e.g., 
Pittsburg, 2000 peakers, Pastoria), Unfair Labor Practice matters, training 
on union-related issues in M&A's.

Let me know if you need any more information, and thanks for your support!

Hector, we need to check with Kriste Sullivan on this.  I have a vague 
recollection about a group of employees going to Dynegy, and we had to send a 
demand letter to prohibit the improper use of Enron information.  She was 
involved, so could you please send her the email you sent to me?  Then, we 
can discuss a strategy.  Thanks.  Michelle

It's no big deal, but I still can't see Kristi's IRA online.  I also don't 
receive statements in the mail for the account.  It looks as if the automated

Shelly,

I am looking for an Analyst to fill a position in Gas Risk Management.  I am 
the West Desk Controller and report to Jeff Gossett.  I think a Book 
Administrator role is a good position for an Analyst.  We have had success in 
with Analysts in our group.  I think it presents a good opportunity for them 
as well.  Please let me know how I can get on a list to talk with potential 
candidates.  I am ignorant of the process, so if I am presuming something 
incorrect, I would appreciate info on how this is supposed to work.  Thanks 
for your help.

Greg,
I got confirmation from the Head Coach at JV that AR is not going to UT. He 
scored a 760 on his SAT and apparently overslept a retake exam.  So I don't 
know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.  Either 
way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.  The coach is really 
dissapointed in AR.

I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was 
going to be free on Saturday.  My brother-in-law is hosting a tournament on 
Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill.  
In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He 
will have a keg.  There will be prizes for the winners.  It is a four man 
best ball scramble.  Tee time is early:  7:30am.  I sent this to guys I 
either know play or think play.  If you have someone else in mind, feel free 
to forward the message.  I don't have a team at all and wanted to see if 
anyone was interested.  Let me know.

Kristi said you called on Saturday.  I was golfing.  What did you think about 
the draft?  I thought LD was a good college player, but not great.  Everyone 
seems to think he will be an All-Pro type player before he's done.  As long 
as he works hard, I think SR would make the best Pro.  But what do I know?

for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will 
present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the 
most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have 
them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout 
is as follows:

 Group1   Group2
 Carole    Jennifer
 Jason    Anne
 Chris   

Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 
11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks.

After looking over the deal, I need to ask Steve Jackson a couple of 
questions.  So I probably will not be able to walk you through the deal today 
because I have some questions myself on a couple of the legs.  I was hoping 
to get this done today.  But for sure by the end of the week.  I want to ask 
you some questions about how Richard wants the books to be changed.  See you 
at 1:00.

Kathy,

Attached are two files:  a mini-book of EC3952.O run for Nov-08 thru Oct-23 
and a copy of the deal in the transport model.  The file is too large to 
email.  There are two tabs:  the first contains deal terms and the second is 
a copy of the P&L sheet as of 12/4/2000.  Call me with any questions you may 
have.  Thanks for your patience.

We need to break out our Midcon region into two separate books starting with 
July production.  We did this with the Market region a couple of months ago.  
If possible, I would like to use these two names:

 ENA-IM Mid Central South
 ENA-IM Mid Central North

Please let me know what needs to be done in order to expedite this request.  
Thanks.

What do you think about us starting to workout together regularly?  Either at 
night or in the mornings, but regularly and for the long term.  Maybe four 
times a week.  Running and some weights in the garage.  I would really like 
to start, even as hard as it will be, to make time for something like this.  
I love you.

I know this is late.  I appologize.  I need some help with the development 
plan.  The review is complete.  Let me know if I need to change some items.

I have a friend who is looking to change employers.  He is in the IT field.  
I was looking on the intranet and found this posting.  Although, he would be 
interested in any similar job.  I will attach his resume.  What is the best 
way to get his resume in front of the proper people?  I would appreciate your 
opinion.  I don't work in the IT field and really don't know anyone at Enron 
that does.  Thanks in advance for your help.

How are you feeling?  I'm very tired and stiff.  I've been thinking, and I 
know you feel like I make all of the decisions around our house when it comes 
to $.  So I want us to do what you want on the pool and a car when it comes 
to financing.  I will completely agree with whatever you think we should do.  
And I'm not doing this for any other reason except that I want you to know 
that I value your judgement and ideas.  Have a great day.  As always, I love 
you very much.

Steve,
Congratulations.  Welcome back.  I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the 
deals we have booked in our system.  I was trying to reconcile them to your 
list of deals.  I could not.  But I think the best thing to do is to simply 
start over and book the deals you tell me to.  I just need the exact terms.  
I know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped, but when you 
get a chance, please give me a call.  Richard wants me to have these deals 
valued by the end of this month's P&L.  Thanks.

We are currently looking into a query which will allow us to see all of our

We have a 7:30 shotgun start tomorrow morning.  We will have to pay and get 
out to our hole, so give yourself some time if you want to hit a few before 
we tee off.  We still need one more person.  Everyone else already had 
plans.  If you know of anyone who would like to play, invite them and let me 
know his name.  Unfortunaltey Jeff, you are the only guy who is any good.

West on Hwy 290
Pass the Beltway - Remember I said it's BFE
Exit Spring Cypress/Cypress Rosehill (About 12 miles past the Beltway)
Go thru 2 stop signs (First one is Spring Cypress-Second one is Cypress 
Rosehill)
After 2nd stop sign, make first right (there is not a stop sign at the 
intersection) - I believe the street is Cypress Chase
The road will dead end into a T
Make a left and the course is on the right - You can't miss it

I'll have my cell phone on if you get lost - 832-563-6328.  Call me if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Diane,

The Chicago region is just me.  If you need my salary, let me know.  I travel 
to Chicago about once a month ($1,750/Trip).  I am a CPA so I like to take 
about 30 hours of classes per year.  I sincerely apologize about my 
tardiness.  Thanks so much for your help.

Gary,

I need some Tagg books set up for the Chicago office.  I submitted a request 
this morning to create a new counterparty:  Enovate, LLC which will be an 
Enron entity.  Under Enovate LLC I need two books:  FT-ENOVATE and 
INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  I also need a book which will fall under the 
current Enron MW, LLC counterparty:  FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  And as 
usual I need these as soon as possible.  I will be out of the office on 
Friday but will return on Monday.  I really need to get deals moved to these 
books by the end of next week.  Please let me know if there is anything I 
need to do to help.  Thanks as always.

OK, so I really screwed up.  I was getting the tickets out last night so I 
wouldn't forget them this morning and remembered that I am going to the 
airport, not the office.  So I'll call you when I get in later this 
afternoon.  I thought about FedEx, but don't want to take the chance that 
they get lost in the Enron building.  I hope you travel via 290 to Austin 
because I think the easiest solution is for me to leave them at my house and 
you could pick them up on you way out.  I also have a couple of EndZone 
passes with the tickets.  Sorry for the screw-up.  I'll talk to you this 
afternoon.

Instead of sending $ in and pulling $ out every month, I am going to stop 
sending $ into the CMA account starting this month.  I actually have already 
done this on the web.  What I need you to do is to stop the monthly purchase 
of APGCX for $340 begining this month.  Also, any idea if I am going to 
receive a 1099 for the recharacterization of the IRAs?  I noticed online 
that  the Roths are now zero.  Thanks.

Jeremy,

Currently, all of our index deals are in the FT-WEST book.  I would like to 
move them all to the GD-NEW book.  I don't want to change any price or basis 
portions of a deal currently in the FT-WEST book, only index.  Please let me 
know if you can do this.  If you have any further questions, please call.  
Thanks.

I would love to go, in fact, PLove is going along with some other Enron 
people.  But I'll be skiing in Colorado.  How's the system?  Did you get the 
other speaker yet?  We have a Christmas present for you.  We want to find a 
weekend when we can come up.  Most likely with the kids.  Let me know.

I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We 
definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather was 
good and the food was great.  How is DC?  Have you seen any of the sights 
yet?  

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when we 
are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let me 
know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and return 
Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights and 
getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the 
neighbors.  

Thanks.  See you when you get back.

Scott,

These places carry the Onkyo receiver.  I don't think they carry Polk, but 
ask them who you should call for Polk speakers.  The place I got mine from a 
couple of years ago no longer carries them.  I'm still looking.  Lee's Audio 
& Video have the Onkyo listed at $629.  Their sight is at leesvideo.com

49 point margin is unacceptable.  I was at the game and it was as if the 
Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put 
together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff.  They were out of 
position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play.  I like Brown 
and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to 
coach.  I lay this all at his feet.  Obviously the coordinators bear some 
major responsibility as well.  I really don't know what to expect for the 
remainder of the season.  They obviously are not as bad as they showed on 
Saturday.  But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly 
on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could 
be humiliated.  I was very wrong.  Something has to change.  The fact is they 
are 3-5 in the last 8 games.  And were favored in all but one.  Lack of 
talent is no longer an excuse.  I think the entire remainder of the season 
hinges on this Saturday.  If they play as poorly as they have all season 
(they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado, 
they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of 
the question.  For this reason, I think that this could be the biggest game 
of Brown's tenure at UT.  What do you think?

We are flying in on Thursday.  We plan on renting a car and driving to your 
place.  I'll update you on specific times early next week.  Because me and 
the kids are using reward miles for our tickets, right now Kristi is not on 
the same flight that the three of us are on.  We are all looking forward to 
seeing you.

Uncle Clark,

It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four 
of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially 
great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret 
that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and 
by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel 
as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's 
like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they 
call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look 
forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be.

Darron

How goes it?  I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for 
March.  I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the 
four of us.  He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying 
with us.  I hope this is OK.  He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out 
one night.  Let me know.  Also,  I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad 
school.  He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.  Talk to you soon.

Regina,

I need two Sitara books set up in a new region.  The region can be called 
Enovate with the books IM Enovate and FT Enovate.  They are part of the other 
Chicago books:  Midwest, Midwest Program 1, and Midwest Program 2.  I have 
attached the book request I sent Susan Trevino.  Let me know if there is 
anything else I need to do.  I want to make sure that the books are not only 
in Sitara, but also in CPR for valuation purposes.  Thanks so much for your 
help.

Happy Holidays!  It looks like we will be going skiing in Colorado from March 
11-16.  I wanted to see if you were going to be in town during that time and 
see if we could come by and see you.  It would most likely be on the 10th and 
then the 16th.  We are staying at a place from that Sunday night thru 
Thursday night.  Let me know.  I hope Santa was good to you all.

Jeff,
I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us 
involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking 
deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last 
one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small 
and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I 
think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in 
preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is 
easier said than done.

First of all, congrats on the big win this weekend.  They keep proving me 
wrong.  Second, sorry this is late.  Friday was 1st day, our longest of the 
month.

   DRAFT

This is a summary of where we stand from a Risk Management perspective on the 
PGT/Socal permanent assignment to Calpine  Currently there are 5 deals in 
Tagg and 1 in the transport  model.

 EC3952.O - Annuity where the West desk pays PGT (from $.08987 to $.17308) on 
67,500/Day thru Oct-23
 This deal will be unwound and this income (approx $30M) will fall out in the 
West desk

 EC3952.F - Buy from Canada of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + 
$.00
 EC3952.K - Sell to AEC of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00
 As of now, these deals will remain unchanged in the system because AEC will 
not let us out of the firm contract

 EC2208.B - Buy from Canada of 22,500/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index - 
$.005
 EC3952.B - Buy from Canada of 15,000/Day thru Oct-01 at Malin for Index - 
$.01
 These deals will be unwound, but discussions between Philip Allen and ??? 
will reveal details not known at this point in time   (Bid/Offer)

 Transport Model - Kingsgate to Malin capacity of 67,500/Day beginning Nov-08 
thru Oct-23
 This deal will have to be unwound or killed - Currently the deal is valued 
at approx $12M in the West Desk

After unwinding these deals, the West desk will be kept whole, the remainder 
will be granted out in orig.

This is my first go at it.  Let me know of any revisions you want.

I don't think I am in the market for any stereo equipment.  But I was 
thinking about trying to sell that land we apparently have through mom.  What 
do you think?  I will never use it.  Let me know.

Uncle Clark,

How are things?  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to see if you 
were going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on 
bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.  I can't believe 
it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.  We are doing well 
here in Houston.  Everyone is getting ready for the school year.  In fact, 
Kristi has already started back.  The kids begin on the 9th.  Enron still 
seems to monopolize my time.  But it's a great place to work.  Let me know 
about that weekend.  I hope you will be in town as  I am looking forward to 
seeing you all.

No, I sent the email to you by mistake.  We will be at Sheri's tomorrow.  How 
do you know her?  Is it through Dawn?  When Sheri sent the message to 
everyone, I noticed your name on the list and called to ask, but you didn't 
pick up, and I didn't leave a message.

Lee, after I put in the deals, the system went down and I was not able to get 
them to calc.  So they are not in these numbers.  They will be tonight.  See 
you guys later today.

you hurt my feelings ........................first , I'm  definetly the 
largest user of outside brokers in this entire firm........could possibly do 
more than anyone in  this market......30-40 "outside " trades each 
day.........second, in this instance he showed me a .25 bid and I hit it, 
then i offered evens( sold several hundred) then i wacked the 75's (again 
several hundred) then hit all the 50's......               when i come back 
to them and ask who I hit they say they have a problem......that it should 
have been an offer...when they listened to the tape they "think" he said 
"sell".......myself, I did nothing wrong in this.....then they come back with 
another name who will stand in at "even"....... well, make him come upto >25 
and send him the check...........I (we) assume all the risk in the broker 
market............brokers collect the commission and have no 
position........we use brokers , pay the commission and also end up with a 
bad position from "flake" trades..........

  didn't mean to vent on you .............using brokers carries 
risk(execution risk).......

Okay, I have coped with the traders in your absence.  Now I intend to leave 
for lunch, my appointment and tomorrow's activities.  All that means that it 
is now your watch.  The only thing that might occur is Mark Breese.  I have 
placed a voice mail to him in response to his Detroit rfp but he is out.  The 
deal should be okay assuming Mark can make the prices work.  Anyway, I will 
handle with Mark.  Hope everyone gets well soon.  I will be back Friday to 
resume the watch.  See ya!

Dave,
 I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable 
to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and 
contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find 
some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major 
concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form 
that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA 
is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and 
as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under 
Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of 
fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items 
under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B.  
Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales 
obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio 
Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default 
by either.  
 Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some 
agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any 
transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term 
of our sales transaction with them.  
 Please call me after you have had a chance to review the contract.

Attached please find the modified Transaction Agreement which has been 
revised to reflect the matters you discussed earlier today.  I modified the 
third item relating to prior approval by Ormet of incremental costs to cover 
the situation that such transportation or supply becomes unavailable during 
the period Enron is obtaining Ormet's prior approval.

that the language in the first 3 cover us if the last agmt isn't done, 
otherwise, the last one covers the trueup of negative values.  Do you 
concur?  Please let me know if these are okay, and I will get my secretary to

Ellen,
 I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each of the 
changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please review and if 
acceptable, please start the execution process by printing two originals of 
each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to me and I will have 
ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get Enovate to sign and return 
their contract and the two transaction agreements to me for forwarding one 
fully set to you.  Please call if you have any questions.  My phone number is 
(713)853-6895.

Please review the attached document to see if it reflects the matters we 
discussed.  I continued Les's marking and added some red-line changes and 
removed some of Les's language which no longer applied.  It will take more 
than an simple accept all changes to get to a clean copy.  Let me know if you 
need a clean copy so that I can clean up the different colors and methods of 
showing changes.

Michael,
 Please note that the footer is wrong on the 1999 MTBE doc.  It should be

I have reviewed the above proposed confidentiality agreement and have made 
certain modifications which are in line with the confidentiality agreement 
presently in effect between ENA and Markwest.  Since the new agreement is to 
cover Markwest for the period that they are letting Enron review Markwest's 
financials which are scheduled to be publicly released next week, the term 
references therein need to only cover the period from the date hereof until 
such financials are scheduled to be released, which I understand to be next 
week.  The change to Enron Corp was made because the employees who will 
receive the information are now employees of Enron Corp.   Please have your 
attorney contact me if there are any problems with the manner or substance of 
the changes noted in the document.

Regarding the January 1, 1998 GISB and the April 1, 1998 GISB, the January 1, 
1998 agreement appears to be a better fit for trading matters which could 
extend beyond one month.  I assume that this was assigned to ENA.

Gary,  
 Please review the foregoing to see if it is your understanding of the deal.  
We have no documentation from Shell Chemical Company to evidence their 
assignment of the contract to Shell Chemical L.P., so I have left the 
Transaction under Shell Chemical Company.  I assume that you are have Steve 
Van Hooser work on the Lease Amendment.  Call me if you need anything

Dave,
 I have taken your word file that you forwarded to Travis McCullough and 
merged it into the Amendment that I had previously forwarded.  The only item 
that needs explanation is your comment concerning Paragraph 11.4.  The signed 
version of the contract that was provided after signature by Charlotte goes 
directly from the SDP language to paragraph 11.5.  As such I would like the 
language inserted that you indicate is already in the contract.  I agree that 
the language was in the versions prior to the final version.  Please call me 
at (713)853-6895 if you have any questions.  If not, please have PG&E sign 
two copies and forward to me.  I will have them signed by ENA and will return 
a fully executed original for your files.

THE GIFT OF LIFE
 submitted by Amber Tozer
 
On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, "Today I 
have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day 
long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of 
50 years."

The cow objected, "What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 
years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you."  So God 
agreed.

On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, "What you are 
supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that 
come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years."

The dog objected, "What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give 
you back my other 10 years of life!"  So God agreed.

On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, "Monkeys 
have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey 
tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span."

The monkey objected. "What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks?  
Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back."  So God agreed.

On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, "Your job is to sleep, 
eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do is 
to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life 
span."

The man objected.  "What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?  
Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way, 
man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and 
the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will 
take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?"  So God agreed.

AND THAT'S WHY....
In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing 
much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support 
the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making 
monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, 
sit by the front door and bark at people!

Keith Ford with TXU Fuel Company confirmed to me this morning that TXU had 
agreed to consent to the assignment of the contracts and that he would fax 
the signed consent to me as soon as he could get an officer to sign same.  He 
agreed to send me a letter to that affect in the event he was unable to get a 
signature today.

FEMALE FLYERS

As the airliner pushed back from the gate, the flight attendant gave the 
passergers the usual information regarding seat belts etc. Finally, she said, 
"Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Campbell and 
crew take you safely to your destination."?

Joe sitting in the 8th row thought to himself, "Did hear her right; is the 
captain a woman? I think I better have scotch and soda. When the attendants 
came by with drink cart, he said, "Did I understand you right?  Is the 
captain a woman?"

"Yes," said the attendant, "In fact, this entire crew is female."

"My God," said Joe, "I'd better have two scotch and sodas. I don't know what 
to think of all those women up there in the cockpit."

"That's another thing," said the attendant, "We no longer call it the 
cockpit."

Gerald,
 Please comment on section 1.6 of the attached document.  I am concerned that 
we might be on the hook for a reimbursement for periods beyond the Term.  Can 
this happen?  If so, is the language in the second attachment sufficient?

which was forwarded to Jeff by Gregg Penman on January 18, 2001 into a 
document.  I have taken the document that Jeff forwarded to Sherry Brinkman 
on December 7, 2000 and included the acceptable changes that Jeff indicated 
were acceptable in his email to Gregg Penman on January 18, 2001.  If this is 
your understanding, please let me know what else needs to be done to finalize

spot deal with the City of Austin.  Please review and let me have your

Lisa,
 Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for 
your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of 
guarantees provided by the credit group.  Apparently one of the analyst had 
the file pulled and on his desk for review.  
 Barbara has also asked that you prepare a Substitution and Release Agreement 
for this guaranty.

 Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895.

I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as 
having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back 
to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with 
CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I 
understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no 
deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under 
these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and 
thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob 
Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the 
preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise.

A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have 
anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone.  
Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him 
after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he 
might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect 
to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He 
reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she 
faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the 
class room sobbing and crying, "Oh my God!... I killed her!  I killed her!"  
All at once he stops dead in his tracks, and a look of dawning comprehension 
appears on his face as he says,... "Wait just a minute!  I didn't kill her.  
She committed suicide!"

Mark,
 Jeff is in London and asked me to make the requested changes to the 
Contract.  I have taken the redline version that he previously provided and 
added the additional changes.  The changes that I made were in 4.2 (15 days), 
Art. 5 (deleted "but for no longer period"), and in  Arbitration (added 
language for independent arbitrators based on the amount in controversy), and 
changed (Texas to New York in the 12th line).   I have also attached a clean 
copy which accepted all of the redline changes.  If acceptable, please print 
2 originals of the clean copy, have them signed, fax me a copy of the signed 
signature page at 7136463490, and mail the two signed originals to me.  Once 
I receive the faxed signature page, I will let Jennifer know so that she can 
have any subsequent transactions entered into pursuant to the terms of this 
contract.  Please call me at 7138536895 if you have any questions.

These are general conceptual concepts that need to be addressed.  I have not 
attempted to redraft the language, only to point out areas where we will need 
to work on modifications to the Contract language.


1. Section 5.01 Provision needs to be changed so that Termination Payment is 
first paid by Company to Customer and if not paid by Company after notice, 
then the Customer would be entitled to make a draw under the Surety Bond.

2. Section 5.03   Provision needs to be changed to reflect that the initial 
bond term shall be __5__ years.  At the end of the initial term, the Company 
shall either replace the bond with a new bond for remaining  term of 
prepayment, provide a letter of credit for the remaining amount of 
prepayment, or provide a corporate guaranty.  

3. Section 7.01 This provision should be okay under the Commodity Futures 
Modernization Act of 2000 enacted as of December 14, 2000.  The Customer 
needs to represent to the Company that the Customer is an "eligible contract 
participant" under the Act.

4. Section 10.02 10.02.05 - Company has no control on the substance of the 
opinion of counsel for the surety bond provider.   The substance of such 
opinion should be as negotiated between the bond providers counsel and the 
Customer.   10.02.06  Should Customers inablility to get funding be an out 
for the Customer?   10.02.08  Likewise, should the Customer's inability to 
complete any swap agreements be an out for the Customer?

5. Section 21.01 21.01.02  Company should get aleast 5 business days notice 
of nonpayment before the Customer should be entitled to cause an Early 
Termination Date.  21.01.03  As previously noted in 5.03, Company should have 
the option to provide alternative surety - as referenced in the Term Sheet.  
Contract and Term Sheet need to be made consistent.

6. Section 21.03 and 21.04   Provisions of the Contract need to be consistent 
so that all obligations of the parties are netted before any payment is 
made.  Also 21.03 should first provide for payment by the Company and if not 
made, then by the surety or other security provider.  We shouldn't have to 
pay the Termination Payment to the Customer and then invoice the Customer for 
any Market Exposure Damages under section 21.06.  These should be netted or 
aggregated in computing the Termination Payment.

Gentlemen:

Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.  The marked 
form is now in black.  I made the requested change in the Term section.  That 
section defines a Early Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3 
contract years.  As such no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract 
section.  Please call if you need anything further.

Craig,
 Attached please find a revised draft of the Ormet Contract.  I have 
incorporated the language from the Credit Worksheet prepared by Jason 
Williams.  That language is included in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Contract 
and in the definitions for Material Adverse Change, Guarantor, Funded Debt, 
Current Ratio, and Net Worth.  
 Regarding Amy Baird's memo, I have made the requested changes in Article 3 
of the Contract regarding changing "Schedule" and "Scheduled" to "deliver" 
and "delivered" and "receive" and "received".  I did not add the language 
requested in (iii) because that language is already included in the 
definition of "Replacement Price Differential".  I included the language she 
requested under (iv) as (iii) in Section 3.2  I omitted the last sentence 
relating to consequential damages of $1,000,000 per occurrence as we 
discussed and left in the language in Section 8.3 which limits the 
consequential damages to a maximum of $1,000,000 during the term of the 
Agreement.  Likewise, I did not delete the language from Section 8.3 
providing that the gas is being supplied solely on the express 
representations and warranties provided in the Agreement and that all other 
warranties are being waived.  I did delete the language relating to Texas law 
and sentence starting with "Therefore, the Parties agree that (i) three" 
because we had agreed to delete the language from Section 4.1 which set forth 
the method of determining a party's liquidated damages.
I added a sentence at the end of Section 8.5 relating to trial before the 
court with waiver of right to jury trial.  I deleted the language relating to 
arbitration in Appendix 1.  
As we discussed, I did not make the change to force majeure.  We need to 
discuss this.  Our obligation should be limited to having firm transportation 
on one of the pipelines with interruptible transportation on the other.  If 
the firm transportation is interrupted because of force majeure, our 
obligation should be limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to 
cause the volumes to be delivered via the other pipeline if there was 
available capacity on such other pipeline.  
 Please review the contract and if you agree that it represents your 
understanding, you may forward it to the folks at Ormet.  I will be out of 
the office on Monday, but will be available by phone.

I believe that the attached is ready.  I have printed 2 copies and have 
initialled those which are in my office EB3878.  Please send someone up if 
you need to sign first.  Otherwise if they are signing first, forward the 
above document to them, have them print it, sign it and forward it to ENA for 
ENA's signature.

Kim,
 I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of 
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If we 
need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the version 
that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for this years 
volume and price.  What is your preference?

 The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on 
ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send 
me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need 
to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it 
out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in 
each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please 
advise.

Dan,
 I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase 
agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made 
no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase 
up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads 
"above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please 
review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, 
please call and I will modify.

Bob Bruce has set up a meeting with Ken Raceler to go over the changes that 
went into effect 12/21 of last year.  They will meet on March 5th from 1 to 3 
p.m. at the Hyatt Regency - Sandelwood Room A.  He says that eventhough they 
are trying to keep the group small it makes sense that you and I attend.  He 
did say that space was not a problem.  I told him that you and I did want to 
attend if for no other reason than to find out about the gray areas that we 
still need to be watchful of.  i.e. who is an "eligible contract participant" 
under the revised law.  What representations need ot be made, if any, by the 
customer?

Please review the language under B of Contract Price of the Transaction 
Agreement to see if it isn't sufficient to cover the concept under item 8 of 
Pasadena Usage under your term sheet.  Likewise, I have added item C under El 
Paso Capacity to cover the sale of 1456 MMBtu/d.  Please check the language 
to ascertain that everything is covered.  Have a good weekend.  I will be in 
all next week if we need to further tweak the language.

Bob,

 It is my understanding that Deal No. NK6915.5 (Sitara # 293550) relates to

   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
  wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer;
  that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
  faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories=
:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your
  liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin=
d
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t=
o
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis=
e
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be
 bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul=
d
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

George,
 I would suggest that the necessary language be added to the Special 
Conditions block of the Transaction Confirmation.  I would suggest the 
following language be inserted in each applicable Transaction Confirmation.

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise contained in the 
sentences previously added to the end of Section 13.5, the parties agree that 
the price to be applicable with regard to any volumes outside of the +/-10% 
tolerance shall be the Gas Daily "Daily Mid-point" price for the day 
following the day that the parties discover the existence of volumes outside 
of the +/-10% tolerance."

Susan,
 I have reviewed the contract form that you provided in November and have 
attempted to make the changes which would be required for Enron to utilize 
the form.  I believe that the red line document attached  should address a 
majority of the issues which  need to be changed.  Please review and give me 
you comments as to the suggested changes.

I believe that the Crestar deal is almost finalized.  According to my 
records, Transaction Number NV8176/370753 was partially documeted with a GTC 
confirm (2000-087crfm.doc attached) dated January 4, 2001.  This covers a 
firm sale of 21,100 MMBtu by Crestar to ENA for the period November 1, 2000 
through October 31, 2001.  The remainder of Transaction Number NV8176/370753 
has been documented with two GTC confirms (2001-023crfm.doc and 
2001-023acrfm.doc also attached) dated March 22, 2001 (Revised).  
2001-023crfm covers the firm sale of 0 - 8,260 MMBtu per day for the period 
November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001 and 2001-023acrfm covers the firm 
sale of 0 -11,740 MMBtu per day, also for the period November 1, 2000 through 
October 31, 2001.  By assignment agreement (Crestar assignment.doc attached) 
dated effective as of April 1, 2001, Crestar assigned 2001-023acrfm to BP 
Canada Energy Marketing Corp.   
Ellen Wallumrod has requested that documentation be provided to her to enable 
her to rebook the portion documented by 2001-023acrfm for the period 4/01/01 
- 10/31/01 as a result of the assignment.  Please provide Ellen with the 
necessary paperwork or forward to the party who needs to provide her with the 
necessary paperwork.

As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you 
faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement 
for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel 
that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the 
agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is 
very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out 
by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replace 
the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call 
me if you need anything further regarding this matter.

 It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that 
end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power 
authorities.

Page 2, item (3) should read "The payment of a "project fee" of $175,000 upon 
the achievement of each milestone described in Exhibit A to this letter.

Item (4) should read "The payment of a "project fee" equal to 2% of the 
project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in 
Exhibit B to this letter.

Exhibit A should read as follows:

Individual milestones subject to "project fee" payments:

1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. ("Haywood Power"), the abandonment 
by the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of 
its Haywood County, Tennessee facility ("Lagoon Creek"), which results in 
Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV 
open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this 
milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth 
in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the 
milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said 
Interconnection Agreement.

2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the 
Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in 
Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of 
$5 million.  Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network 
Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA 
and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved 
upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network 
Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is 
less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the 
$175,000 project fee shall be paid.

3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. ("Calvert"), the elimination 
of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade 
consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from 
Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to 
occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion 
that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are 
viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and 
Calvert.

Exhibit B should read as follows:

The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with 
or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a "Development 
Project"). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt 
or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively  to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) 
days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed 
Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any 
Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the 
Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be 
deemed to be an approved Development Project (an "Approved Project"). For 
purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be 
achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of 
construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial 
operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee 
shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an 
Approved Project as defined herein.

One additional point I should have mentioned on last e-mail...While it was 
good to spend this visit exclusively in the office, I want to find additional 
ways to contribute to the group during my future stays in the London office. 
If there are meetings outside the office, with regulators or others, where I 
could be of value, please let me know. I will try to give as much advance 
notice as possible of future stays in Europe. I'm feeling my way through this 
new role  and will be looking to the four of you for guidance, both as to 
where I can contribute and where I can't. Thanks.

Could each of you get me by next Friday( May 18,2001) a list of the top 5 
priorities for each of your respective areas....and, if, possible, a 
consensus document reflecting the top 8-10 priorities for the entire group? A 
brief description of each of the priorities would be appreciated with an 
attempt to quantify, where possible, the value associated with each of the 
priorities( either value potentially created or loss of value avoided). 
Thanks.

I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently her 
concern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparent 
current performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an action 
plan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. Thanks.

Mike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the 
presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the 
presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you 
would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the 
SUN demonstration.  

With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone 
contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be 
possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are 
the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone 
numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  

Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we 
have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to 
reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and 
the meeting room set up "class room" style.  If we go with the plated 
breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 "10-tops," there will be no 
space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 
people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing 
to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting 
room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the 
YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and 
will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff 
are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.

I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.  Thanks, SRS

Patti,

It was good to see you and Mike last night. 

I wanted to follow up on the MS150 - I can assure you that you will do fine 
without training (assuming, of course, that you have a bike).  I did it that 
way twice before with no major complications.  Given your running, you will 
do better.  It really is a lot of fun.

Sherri is checking to see if you can join the Enron team.  We will be the 
first team off on Saturday morning and the team has good facilities (tents, 
food, etc.) that improve the experience.  GO FOR IT!!

Jeff

PS - hi, Patti - this is Sherri.  I did check with our team captain and she 
said you could join our team so long as you do so by Friday.  She is going to 
e-mail all the necessary forms and information to me, which I will forward to 
you today if you are interested.  Let us know!  Hope all is well...

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee.  
I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate 
Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all 
important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time 
with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking 
about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any 
questions you may have.

To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, 
November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person 
and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged.  
Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.

I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for 
spending your time on this critical process.

Jeff

Metin,

Great to hear from you.  Believe it or not, my brother lives in Istanbul and 
my son Jeffrey and I are going to visit him this summer - somewhere in the 
June 23 to June 28 timeframe.  I'd love to see you if it's possible.  I'll 
let you know when my plans are firm.

Mark,  

Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was 
wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.  He is in the 
process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to 
guage your interest.  He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation 
area and the Serengeti.  I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once 
received from the guides.

Please let us know if you're at all interested.

Thanks, Sherri

Amelia, I was able to collect the remainder of the pledges ($5,140).  Please 
let me know where you are located, and I'll try to get it over there today.  
If you happen to be in the building and want to stop by, that's fine, too.  
Katherine knows where it is if I'm not at my desk.  SRS

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you 
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, 
the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 
30th.  

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) 
at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a 
success.

John, you should have received a copy of the e-mail you sent to Jeff, which I 
in turn forwarded to Greg Whalley.  To bring you up to speed - Greg Whalley 
is the Chairman & CEO of Enron Net Works - EnronOnline and all IT resides in 
this business unit (in some of the e-mails in the string you sent me, Jay 
Fitzgerald and Jenny Rub were mentioned - they both report to Greg).  If you 
don't hear from him within a reasonable amount of time, please let me know.

Hope all is well...

Regards,

Dear Mr. Kester,  

We are in receipt of your letter dated January 26, 2001, regarding a 
sponsorship opportunity at Energy West's Summer Energy Conference.  Upon 
review, we have decided to decline participation.

We thank you for extending the invitation to Enron and send best wishes for a 
successful conference.

Hi, Suzanne.

I was wondering if you would do me a favor.  You have sent a couple of 
packages to Jeff's home by UPS or FedEx.  Unfortunately, Jeff is never there 
to sign for them, so the packages are delayed in getting to him as we have to 
track them down.  UPS is very good about rerouting to the business address, 
but FedEx won't reroute without the permission of the sender (i.e., you).  

At any rate, in the future if you would send packages to Jeff at Enron Corp., 
1400 Smith Street, EB5008, Houston, Texas, 77002, I would really appreciate 
it.  And of course, anything marked "confidential" is opened only by him.

Thanks a lot, Suzanne.  Hope all is well with you.

Sherri

Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you 
meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.  They don't take 
reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.  Let 
me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to 
pick you up.

Have a good time.  SRS

about roses.

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting 
firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and 
simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron 
Company Code, which is: 

C673EV

To begin the survey, click on the link below:

You may also copy this link and paste it into your favorite browser.

Thank you.

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling (who, by the way, has really enjoyed 
the old pictures being e-mailed back and forth).  He has asked me to find out 
what the schedule of events is for the SMU Homecoming October 27-29.  He's 
unable to attend any events on the evening of Saturday, October 28, as he 
will be at the wedding of a very good friend; however, if there are events 
scheduled outside of that time, he would very much like to be there.

Can you provide this information or pass me on to whomever can?  Any 
assistance is greatly appreciated.

Hi, Mark.  The itinerary is changing a little bit with regard to where you 
are staying while in Africa, so I will forward the latest and greatest as 
soon as I get it.  Probably sometime late this week...

Just wanted to be sure that you are working on getting your Tanzanian visa 
and getting the required shots.

Congratulations on the new job - I guess this means you'll be staying for a 
while?

Ms. Robinson, 

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, to whom Kay Cole introduced to you 
via e-mail.  He would like to speak to you by phone regarding his daughter 
Kristin's potential interest in attending Boston University.  Would you be 
willing to provide us with your phone number?

Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you with your 
future visits to Houston.  I looking forward to hearing from you soon.

out for Jeff Skilling?  If so, would you please remove it?  I print this for 
him every day and fax it to him when he's traveling.  Please let me know how 
I might do that.  Thanks, SRS

Dear Mr. TenHave,

We are in receipt of the above referenced letter addressed to Mr. Jeff 
Skilling.  At this time, Enron has no interest in investing in prime 
timber/woodlands.  We do, however, thank you for the opportunity and wish you 
success in this endeavor.

Beek,

Rocky asked me to let you know that he is really hoping to be at the party 
Friday evening and at the game Saturday afternoon, but he'll have to be home 
Saturday night for a wedding.  We'll keep you posted on how it works out, but 
so far it's looking like he'll be there for part (perhaps most?) of the fun.

Sanjay, Jeff asked me to write you to introduce you to Gerald Chan, the 
brother of Ronnie Chan (ENE director).  Gerald has been investing in capital 
ventures in the US and Asia for many years.  Of late, he has been running 
into companies in which Enron is investing or is interested in investing, and 
Jeff met with him today to discuss this.  Jeff suggested that Gerald contact 
you to discuss further.  I have provided Gerald with your telephone numbers, 
address and e-mail address.  You should expect to hear from him shortly.

For your information, below is the pertinent information on Gerald:

Johnathan,

My name is Sherri Sera, and I work for Jeff Skilling.  Jeff has asked me to 
see if you have a completed e-mail list for Class #64, and if so, could you 
send it to me.  I'm assisting him in getting the group together Saturday 
afternoon or evening, and he would like to poll the group to see if that is 
something they would like to do.

I appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Dear John,

On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI 
to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not 
before Jeff saw a printed copy.

Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon 
his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will 
pursue this opportunity.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

I'm going through all of your e-mails to Jeff and am not able to find the 
information on Elvis' party Friday night.  Someone had sent an attachment 
with the details, but I was unable to open it.  Would you mind sending us the 
"final" agenda for the festivities this weekend?  Jeff will arrive in Dallas 
+/- 4:00p Friday night and will be staying at the Crescent Court hotel.  
Thanks so much!  SRS

Sorry about that.  He told me that you guys have rescheduled for tomorrow

reservation at Carrabas on Kirby in your Dad's name at that time.  Please let 
me know if you have a conflict.  Thanks, SRS

PS - I also have you down for lunch with your Dad on Friday, November 10 - do 
you have it down, too?

Ron, 

Your e-mail was such a pleasant surprise!  Thanks so much for the kind words.

I would love to get together for lunch in the near future, though January is 
typically a tough month for me.  I'll have my assistant, Sherri Sera, call 
your office to see what we can arrange.

Thanks again for the note.  I look forward to seeing you soon.

Jeff

Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe 
it has already come and gone!

Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the 
Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so 
if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - 
I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it 
in the mail to:

Sherri Sera
c/o Enron Corp.
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, TX 77251-1188
U.S.A.

Thanks and take care,
Sherri

Hi, Mark.  Hope you enjoyed Italy - I was in Capri and Positano a couple of 
weeks ago and loved it!

Jeff asked me to write you to see if the plan he is hatching will work for 
you...

He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to 
see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay 
there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi 
and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another 
place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out 
later...

You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough 
sketch of the safari is as follows:

7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club
7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at 
Ngorongoro Crater Lodge
7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge
7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp
7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp
7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey

Hope it sounds good to you.  Please let me know and I'll begin making flight 
arrangements, etc...I'm also collecting all the information with regard to 
required Visas and innoculations (there is a long list!); I'll pass that on 
when I receive it.

I'm heading to Las Vegas tomorrow for a long weekend, so will be in touch 
again early next week.  

Take care, SRS

Hello - yes I am one in the same.  It really is a small world.

Though my schedule is pretty hectic right now with travel, etc., give me a 
call the next time you're in the building.  Maybe we can have a cup of coffee 
and catch up.

Mr. Compton,

This meeting is most definitely on. My apologies if there has been any doubt 
on your part; however, Jeff has been traveling about 90% of the time since 
mid-February, which has put us a bit behind schedule.  I will be in touch 
with you soon to schedule a phone call with Jeff.

Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and 
co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to 
speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular "5 minutes") about his company.  Jeff has 
asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 
617.493.5597.

(Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse 
- i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).

Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to 
Franz.

SRS

PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for 
you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his 
family to Houston...

Hello, Mark.  The person you can speak to at Enron is Eric Shaw=20
(44.207.783.5408) - he heads up that part of Europe out of our London=20
office.  By copy of this e-mail, I'm letting him know to expect your call.

Glad to hear all is well.  Good luck with your project!  SRS

Jeff,

I am preparing a report here for a client about foreign companies'
experiences here in Turkey.  I was wondering if it would be ok for me to
contact someone involved with Enron=01,s Turkey operation.  I suspect that =
any
such information is confidential, or at least sensitive, but if not, would
be very interesitng.  Please do not hesitate to say a big loud no.  Just
asking!

Hope all else goes well.  We should plan on talking on the phone sometime
soon, just for grins.

Mark

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no 
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner was 
cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need 
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; 
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make 
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from 
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will 
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and John 
Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the panel.

I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, 
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call 
me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not 
have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Regards, SRS

Good morning, Kristin.  Your Dad would like to meet you today at Maggiano's 
(located at 2019 S. Post Oak Blvd., 713.961.2700).  I'll make a reservation 
for 12:00 noon - he'll be there then, and I know you'll probably be a few 
minutes later than that.  Let me know if you want another plan.  SRS

Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst. I had 
about $30 worth of change (loonies and twoonies) taken from my desk drawer 
between Friday and this morning.

Could have been the smed guys, the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all 
I know. 

Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing 
happen to him last week.

Kerri,

This is a test. If you receive this message I correctly wrote down your

How was your birthday? Were you reasonably well behaved? How is your week 
shaping up? We should grab a coffee one night soon.

Give me a call or w/b

I have never done a houseboating trip but they sound like a lot of fun. Was 
the weather good? Houston was hot. Very hot. I better get used to it though 
because I'm moving there. That is why I have been so crazy lately. I am going 
down there to trade power in the North East. Pretty crazy shit. I gotta hop 
but I'll write more later.

John,

I am planning to come to Houston Wednesday and Thursday to sit with the East 
desk. Unless that is going to create problems, would you mind letting them 
know that I'm coming.

What is the address of the HR website where I can see my old pay stubs? I'm 
trying to sort out my parking situation.

Thanx

Kim,

I received the benefit book and will look through it tonight. Do you know the 
name of the lady I am susposed to be in contact with at Enron relocation 
services? She called me yesterday but I have forgotten her name. I am 
wondering if I need to have my visa done before she will book the movers. In 
regards to my visa, I have gathered pretty much all the info. that Margaret 
needs with the exception of University transcripts. I had to order those and 
probably won't get them untill early next week.

Thank you for all your help!

Chris

Find attached resume and cover letter. Hopefully he didn't spel anyting 
incorrectly. 

Dan is really smart and a hard worker. I think he would be a good fit.

Give me a call Tuesday afternoon to discuss (gone to Kelowna golfing for the 
weekend).

Varsity called and the water pump needs to be replaced. 

It is going to be $700. I told them to go ahead and fix it.

Hope that's OK.

FX is a total fucking mess in Calgary. I have actually thought about the 
problems a little bit. Call me if you want to talk about specifics (x3-1663). 
Things in Houston are good. The weather is great now. Year round golf is 
nice. Power is a total shit show. The volatility is crazy and this is the off 
season. I need to get rested up for the summer. Take it easy

How's it going? Hear you are working pretty crazy hours. Went to NN with the 
boys on Saturday and played golf in Kananaskis yesterday so all in all a good 
weekend. I have a post stampede cold so I won't be doing much other than work 
and sleep for a few days. Take it easy and write back when you get a minute.

I am 80% going to the rodeo on Thursday. It is the Enron customer party that 
day. As for Nashville North I don't know if we are going there or somewhere 
else after. I am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school 
nights. I likely won't be going out again until Friday or Saturday. Am I 
going to get an eye infection if I continue to wear your sunglasses around 
town? I hope not. Chicks dig me in those glasses.

Ryan,

Good to hear things are going well. I am still with Enron but I am in the 
process of moving to Houston. I'm going down there to trade electricity so 
that should be interesting change from nat gas. No wife. No house. No liver. 
That's about it. Hope India was a good time. 

Keep in touch!

Saturday was really fun. Golf was great. Mike and Andrew's group was by far 
the drunkest foursome. Dinner was good and then we went to the Sutter club to 
play pool. That is when things got out of hand. We got Ryan a bright yellow 
T-shirt with "NOBODY KNOWS I'M A LESBIAN" written in big block letters. Call 
me tonight and I'll give you all the gory details. My head still hurts.

Lavorato never let his people put their titles on business cards until they 
became managers. It doesn't really matter. I never really understood why he 
cared. I think they look more professional with titles. You should ask Jan.

How's it going? Did you have a good time in Victoria? I have been running 
around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to get ready to move. Went 
to Red Deer this weekend and played a little golf. Pretty relaxing. I have so 
much shit to do. I better hop.

I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want 
to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis. I told him I told 
you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say. He said they are 
looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality.

Anne,

I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I 
get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-company 
mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't 
received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird. 

Thanx 

Chris Dorland

Where are we at on credit with these guys. 

They won't sell me gas because they say we need to increase Enron Canada's 
parental guarentee.

This is costing me deals and I need to know what is going on soon.

Nav,

How are you doing? What are you doing? I am still working for Enron. I have 
been trading nat gas for about 3 years. I am moving to Houston at the end of 
the month. In my next life I am going to be trading electricity in the NE US. 
Should be interesting. Crazy volatility. I will probably have a heart attack 
at 26 but that's life. Hope things are going well for you.

w/b

I cannot seem to suspend my product without hitting the red hand button (not 
an option when I right click on the product and not red stop light).

Can you come and see me when you get in. We need to do more to tie out the 
risk in our physical book than agree on the number of molecules we are long 
or short. My model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile. We 
need to produce a report from the Intra-month book that we can use to tie 
out. If that doesn't exist we should talk systems about creating it. 
Hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups.

Thanx,

Chris

How are things going? Learning lots? Went to the rodeo and then to Nashville 
North yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today. I'm not doing anything today 
but tommorow I am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that 
should be good for a headache. Friday I'm going to the Chick Wagon party and 
Saturday to Nashville North with the boys. Weather has been good and looks 
like that will continue. Did you find a gym yet?

Kim,

Could you please explain (pretent you are talking to a 4 year old) the 
details of the following.

a) Health care coverage provided by Enron and any costs associated with that 
coverage including:
 - Medical
 - Dental
 - Vision
Is this enough coverage? Is there supplemental coverage available? What is / 
is not covered? 

b) Life / Accidental Death and Dismemberment / Disability Insurance 

  - What (if any) is provided coverage?

c) What programs concerning retirement saving (company matched savings, 
pension benefits ect...) will I participate in?

 - What are these programs? 
 - How do I sign up?

d) I am told I should opt out of social security. How does that work?

e) What is my vacation allocation? How do unused vacation day work in the US? 

f) In Canada, we have a "Health Spending Account" of $1000 / year that we can 
allocate towards eye glasses, health club memberships ect...
 
 - Does a similar program exist in the US?

g) I will be required to file 2 tax returns (Canada and US) in 2000. Will 
Enron cover the cost of having those returns prepared?

h) Is parking at the Allen Center covered in the offer? If not, could it be? 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Chris Dorland

I am sorry I was short with you on the phone. The gas market is a total shit 
show and our economics are out by $1M . I worked until midnight last night 
and I am very tired. We should buy an ice cream cake from DQ and cook some 
steaks on Saturday after golf. Danny and I can leave after dinner or first 
thing in the morning on Sunday. I hope your (and my) work week improves. See 
you tommorow!

Dad,

I don't know if Dan wants to play on Saturday, I forgot to ask. Is there room 
for Brad to play? I talked to him last night.
If no, I will probably try to get a game with Brad and Darren Easy on Sunday. 
Talk to you soon.

Kathy,

Could you run a report that lists all of the FX hedges in our book. I just 
want to make sure we aren't missing any deals in our model.

Thanx,

Chris

Dad,

When are you buying mom a new Jeep? I need to sell my truck and do it fast. I 
was thinking I could trade it in towards mom's new one and that might be the 
best way to get at least decent money for it. Just a thought.

Speak of the devil.  Tino called, all full of optimism and questions.  They 
have pitched the DOE a deal in which Dennis builds three 50 Mw turbines on 
the Isleta, and a 7 mile power line to DOE's distribution lines.  The project 
will apparently be 100%debt financed, with DOE agreeing to pay a firm demand 
charge rate of between 8 and 9 cents/kwh.  That rate is supposedly high 
enough to service the debt on a 10 year amort. basis (remember, DOE can only 
sign 10 year contracts).  DOE is interested, says Tino, because of the 
redundant, dedicated facilities and enhanced reliability, and because Dennis 
and Tino pitched DOE on all the $$$$ DOE will make from the surplus power 
sales.  Dennis apparently pitched them a "share the upside" deal under which 
DOE keeps most of the revenue from surplus sales.  Tino showed DOE the July 
spot prices at 4 Corners, which Tino said included many days over $200/Mwh 
and they got all excited.  DOE has done a similar share the upside deal at 
one of its facilities in Calif. Tino says and they have occasionally come out 
net positive on elec. costs in some months so they like the approach.  Tino 
had two questions:
1.  Does TW have 30-40,000/d of permian capacity available starting sometime 
in 2001 or 2002?  (I realize we have probably answered this question about 5 
times, but lets do it again for him). 
2.  Is there someone at ENA Tino can talk to about a getting a quote for long 
term and/or short term power purchase prices for Four Corners delivery?   If 
he can get something the DOE thinks is a good price, they m ay just sell all 
the surplus power forward.  If not, they'll just hang on to it and sell it 
into the cash market in monthly and daily deals.  

Thanks.  DF

I saw in the press that N.M. has delayed electric open access until Jan 1, 02 
for residentials and small commercials and to July 1, 02 for large 
industrials.  That increases the likelihood that the Pueblo project will have 
to dump power in the wholesale market at 4 Corners for a while before retail 
markets start to open up.  One more thing to factor in.

I'm expecting to hook up with Bill Votaw of Enron Federal Solutions today to 
talk about Langley's "sole source" procurement strategy with DOE.  I hope to 
get Votaw on the phone with Langley's D.C. govt. contracts lawyers to discuss 
their theory.  We should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole 
source strategy is really a high risk approach.  I'm not sure where that 
would leave us because the only other approach I can think of is to steer DOE 
into opening the power plant up for bids.  Langley does not appear interested 
in trying to win an open bid for the power plant, although frankly we would 
probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning.

Once we clear up the government contracts issues (if ever) it seems to me 
that it would be time to expand the team to include Federal Solutions 
(potentially, if they see an angle to help them with their Kirtland 
outsourcing strategy) and ENA.  The ENA involvement would be particularly 
important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the 
specifications/economics that would result.  I'm probably engaging in wishful 
thinking again, but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine/heat 
exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics 
from the model that James ran.   If we think this thing is a potentially 
viable deal after I talk to Votaw and the Langley DC team, we need to grab 
Bill Cordes and discuss whether we go to ENA "from the bottom up," or through 
Stan "from the top down" to get hooked into a deal team over there.  Kevin, I 
still intend to hook you into the Votaw-DC call if you are available.  
Thanks. DF

Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a 
glowing report on the situation.  His opening day group is down to 6 guys so 
he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot at the 
rest.  He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out to fast 
and getting mad.    I assured him that the way we all shoot that wouldn't be 
a problem.  
When:  Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29.  
Where:  Kenebec S.D.  (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from 
Omaha)
$$:   $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.   If we dwindle to less 
than 8, its $100 per guy.  (he will cut us some slack on this if some of you 
can only hunt 2 days.)
Fish:  Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included
Lodging :  Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is 
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.  Super 8 is a 
lovely place:  motto is "Labs sleep free."  $100 per night, 4 guys per room+ 
$25/head/night.

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have 
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.   I'd like to get 10 locked 
in solid by end of Sept.  More than that would make the hunting a little 
clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due around 
this time.  What a lame excuse!!  You were there for the first 4, right?  
Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?  If you guys have anyone else that's 
interested other than the folks that have already been invited, let me know 
as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have around 10.  
Talk to you.  DF

In anticipation of potential litigation involving TW's operational 
activities, please prepare an analysis for me of the reasons for TW's sale of 
excess natural gas at the California border.  I am aware of several of these 
sales and have been  informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic 
reason for them.  I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the 
following information:
1.  What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make 
it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border?  
2.  What is the process that is followed to make such a determination?
3.  Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an 
operational sale is necessary?
4.  In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do 
those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to 
previous years?
5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision 
to make a sale is reached? 

Thanks for your attention to this request.  Please give me a call to discuss 
and please designate your response as "Privileged and Confidential, Attorney 
Client Privileged."

Assuming we keep Arthur Anderson on board this afternoon and assuming Enron 
is still in the business of doing asset monetizations like this one (which 
better be the case since its in the TW 4th Q plan @$2.5 mm), the following 
things need to happen on roughly the following timetable:

1.  Mike talks to Hanover and we negotiate the price, specific contract 
language, etc.  (hopefully within 2-3 weeks of turning Mike loose?)

2.  Regulatory (assisted by Maria and me) flanges up the FERC abandonment 
filing and tees it up to file the minute Mike finalizes the deal with 
Hanover.  We haven't talked about this for a while, but the story we tell  
FERC has to acknowledge that the monthly O&M cost will be higher under our 
outsourcing deal than it currently is, if load factor and other operating 
assumptions remain constant.   That may be the key to our story line--we 
argue that outsourcing is necessary to creating flexibility in our cost 
structure to protect us and our ratepayors from market changes, gas flow 
changes, and capacity turnbacks.  The Compression Services Agreement, as it 
is currently drafted, has a two part demand-commodity rate.  Thus, if our 
throuput goes to pot on the segments where these outsourced compressors are, 
or if we have big capacity turnbacks, the outsource deal allows us to shed 
costs quickly.  Charlie's preliminary cost spreadsheets seem to me to support 
this strategy.  I'll talk to Maria and MKM's team about this.  Also, we need 
to be able to explain to explain that our deal is not all that new or 
radical.  It is just a tiny bit different from the many deals FERC has seen 
where compression or other services are outsourced from the get-go with new 
facilities.  For example, FERC allowed NNG to outsource compressor motor 
operation and ownership using ECS (and, by tomorrow, hopefully will allow TW 
to do the same at Gallup).  Florida has a similar deal, as well as 
intrastates like HPL.  Maria and I and MKM's folks need to turn over every 
rock to find examples of similary outsourcing that don't involve Enron.  We 
need to let FERC know that the outsourcing train has already left the station 
and we just want to jump on board.         

3.  We get the abandonment order in the 4th Q and do the deal.  (Will we have 
the chance to do some more schmoozing and lobbying of FERC folks before we 
file--i.e., at a prefiling conference???)  

See how easy these deals are when you use assumptions to eliminate the many 
problems!

Do we need to give notice to customers before we shut in receipt points due 
to off-spec gas?  Sec. 44 of the NN tariff implies to me that if a customer's 
gas has too much water, for example, we can shut it in at any time without 
notice.  Please confirm ASAP.  DF

 Just got an update on the project that won't go away.  Dennis has a meeting 
lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the 
project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read 
"financed by") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\or third 
parties (read "Enron"?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get 
a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, 
even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas 
load.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics 
using about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' 
argument is going to be:  "I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and 
the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you."  
"You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, 
you will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or 
escalate, you lose."    Either way, your reliability improves and you kick 
PNM in the shins."  Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on 
this.  By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, 
and won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even 
more publicity.  You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely 
to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or 
cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real 
angle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor 
out there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got 
hosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.  
 I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together 
to give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.  Other than that, I 
just told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the 
project if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be 
interested in the design/build on all of it.  He said he'd get back to me 
after the 25th meeting and tell me whether the project is undead.  DF

Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off 
shippers' supply due to force majeure?  

1.    If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly 
no.  We're shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the 
tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to 
grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent 
operators and so long as we don't discriminate.   If that gas is out of spec 
on any of the specific items listed in the "Quality" section of the tariff 
(Sec. 44?  47?  I can't remember which but its one of those) then the answer 
is the same.  

2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the 
answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons 
falling out as liquids.  I'm remembering the catch all section of the Quality 
paragraph as prohibiting "dirt, gums, and other impurities that would 
interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah" or something to that 
effect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and 
heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people 
delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no 
force majeure.   I read Eric's very scientific email and I think the punch 
line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The 
thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. 
limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers 
are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't 
work as good.  

3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we 
could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an 
event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.

I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF

I just talked to Frank about my revised draft of the rehearing request.  
Susan, you will be pleased to learn that he has successfully talked me out of 
starting world war 3 with the FERC.  I've asked Frank (and Steve) to massage 
the draft to avoid a frontal challenge to FERC's disclosure policies and then 
to work with you to get it finalized. The plan is to carve out a limited 
exception to the normal disclosure rules given that the Gallup case is over 
and there is  no pressing need for disclosure in advance of the normal 
discount report filing.  Thanks.  DF

I have no great interest in appealing the FERC order denying rehearing.  This 
one is a loser as it was decided on TW-specific facts and I see no clear 
inconsistency between FERC's various orders on revenue sharing.   Unless 
someone feels strongly to the contrary, lets punt.  Thanks. DF

I met with Ms Caplan yesterday and had a good discussion.  I was pretty 
impressed with her.  The only down side is that her inability to sit for the 
Texas bar is a hangup for a lawyer position.   I suggested that she also look 
into getting her license in New York or D.C. as I think those jurisdictions 
are less reluctant to allow non-U.S. lawyers to sit for the bar than Texas 
is.  I'll talk to Mike Moran, Dot McCoppin, Britt Davis and Shelley Corman 
regaring possible positions in GPG.  Have you thought about Steve Kean's 
group?  They might be able to use someone like Emma.  I plan to write her in 
a couple of weeks to follow up with any additional leads I've found.  Enjoyed 
shootin the shit with you, as always!  DF

I called Tino today to let him know that our affiliates are sniffing around a 
power plant opportunity and potential gas bypass pipeline in Albuquerque.   
Kevin, you should be getting a call from a guy in Portland whose name I can't 
seem to find right now.  He had gotten my name from Thome out there and 
called to let me know that ENA is interested in pitching either PNM or some 
outfit called "Delta" on development or expansion of a gas-fired power plant 
in the south part of Albuquerque.  It didn't sound to me like ENA was very 
far along in their deal.  I explained to this guy what we were involved in 
and swore him to confidentiality.  I also told him he need to call either 
Kevin or Steve before he talked to PNM.  I thought it was a little curious 
that ENA is interested in generation in Alb. all of a sudden.  

On the Tino front, he apologized for not calling after their big DOE 
meeting.  He said it went very well and that DOE is considering their 
offer--$.085/Kwh power less revenue sharing for all surplus power sold.  Tino 
and Dennis offered DOE 70% of the $$ from the surplus power sales until a 
certain target is hit (probably a target equivalent to DOE's current PNM rate 
less 10%) and then 30% of any additional $$.   Tino and Dennis really blew 
some smoke by showing the DOE guys this summer's Four Corners spot prices 
(generally in the $200-400/mwh range) and doing the math for them. On that 
basis, the net delivered power cost after rebate comes pretty close to zero.  
Even using a more reasonable sampling of Four Corners prices, the DOE price 
is apparently better than their current PNM price.  The big issue is whether 
DOE can figure out how to keep the rebate $$ at Sandia, rather than lose the 
$$ to treasury.   Sounds like the Dennis and Tino show is still flogging this 
deal pretty hard, so I reminded Tino that we are eager to do anything we can 
to help. 

Bill or Kevin, please forward this to Bill Gang--I couldn't get my computer 
to recognize his name.  

Please call if you have any questions.  DF

I am advised that some of you have not exhibited the requisite amount of 
"pep."  For lawyers and paralegals, you need to pick your reviewers online if 
you haven't already done so.  5 or 6 would be sufficient althought the 
computer lets you pick up to 10.  For those of you who picked more than 5 or 
6 I have reduced that number, based on my thoughts about which of your chosen 
reviewers have had the most direct contact with you and are most likely to 
give a thorough review.  Let me know if you think I really blew it.  For 
secretaries, the online stuff is optional.  If you don't use it, I will 
solicit input from the people you work with like I have in the past and 
consolidate it with my own comments on one form.   Thanks.  DF

I heard that NE Hub made it through the Oriskany without blowing anything 
up.  Siggy must have been so pleased, and Penn Fuel and CNG so disappointed!  
Hey, I'm gonna be down the week of May 30-June 3 and would like to get 
together with you guys.  What's going on that week?  Would there be any 
reason, say, to bring golf clubs?  I hear that my much ballyhooed former law 
partner David Hill might be down in Houston the same time and I need to have 
a few beers on his expense account as well.  Pat, I don't think you've met 
this guy but you need to, if for no other reason because he buys beers.   DF

just as a courtesy  to let him what you guys are looking at at Bushton and 
let him know I put you up to it.  If he has some useful off the cuff

any material or get him deeply involved--just give him a heads up.  DF

We are now addressing the distasteful task of sorting through the mountain of 
files accumulated during the Conoco litigation.  Kathy is taking the lead on 
reviewing our document retention policies and advising Britt and I of what 
she thinks we can destroy and what we need to keep.  In some instances, the 
appropriate approach is not entirely clear.  Have you folks run across any 
"document retention policy specialists" that she ought to talk to?  We have a 
fairly detailed policy applicable to "Interstate Law" (which I guess means 
GPG law--the policy document is fairly old) but I'm less clear on what 
authority or right Legal has to enforce the doc. retention policy as to other 
groups.  Rod Hayslett suggested during Conoco that it would be good if Legal 
followed up now and then and made sure that pack rats were following the 
policy.   His comment arose from a little situation in which we were served 
with requests for "3 year plans" and Rod was displeased  to learn that some 
folks had kept old plans from 10 years ago.  He (and I suspect all of us) 
would be happier if that didn't happen again.  Any thoughts?  Thanks. DF

I read Wednesday's NGPL order (RP00-18-002) as applying only to NGPL due to 
their unique restrictions and tariff rules.  I do not read it as forcing the 
rest of the industry (i.e., us) to use the floor rate as the reserve price 
for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids.  I think we 
can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the ENA deal 
based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index 
mechanism.  I.e., on that type of deal, we can determine that the index 
mechanism is worth "x cents" to us and require a discounted recourse rate 
bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win.  Agreed?  

Note that NGPL whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at 
a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry (i.e., us) on this 
issue.  The commission didn't say anything about that, implying to me that 
the rest of us are still free to do what NGPL cannot do.   DF

You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  

Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective 
files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF

Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited 
about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 
300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested 
in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are 
basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation 
charge per KW of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for 
power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or 
$10/kw if combined cycle.  Variable cost would be $.005/kwh and fuel is 
whatever it is--ENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, 
but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  

Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA 
guys.  Thanks.  DF

Another Tino-gram.  DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a $7.06/mo 
demand charge per KW in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge.  Tino didn't 
know whether that was per KW of monthly demand, per KW of non-coincident peak 
usage, or what.  The PNM tariff for govt. service is priced at $7.16/KW of 
"demand above 10,000kw during peak period"  (peak period is daytime) so I 
assume that is how it is calculated.  If that is the tariff ("Schedule 
4000B") under which DOE really takes service, this is interesting because 
that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate.  It is also 
interesting that DOE is paying $.053/kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B 
energy rate is $.05072/kwh (maybe the difference is surcharges or something). 
Tino's consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an 
incremental $.011 in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge, for a total 
delivered PNM rate to DOE of $.064/kwh.  This is not as good as the 7 cent 
number Tino threw around earlier in the week, but its still not terrible.  If 
the bogey is a 10% reduction to the current rate, our number to beat is 
$.0576/kwh.  Tino promised us copies of DOE's actual energy bills to confirm 
these numbers.  That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you 
and I talked about yesterday, Kevin.    

Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta's consultant that the 
Cobisa Belen project is dead.  Do we know anything about this???  
Interesting.  I'm waiting to hear back from Bill Votaw to line up a due 
diligence call to Tino's government contracts lawyers in DC to confirm 
whether the "sole source" strategy is legit.  Kevin, I'll let you know when 
this is scheduled in case you want to be on the call.  Thanks.  DF

I got a call from Tino earlier today (right after our meeting on Pueblo) but 
could only talk to him for a few minutes before I had to jump off.  I did let 
him know that Kevin or Lorraine would be calling to talk about info that we 
need to complete our analysis of the economics.  He also let me know that 
they are looking at another power plant project in the SW Power Pool and want 
to discuss with us.  Thanks.

As I understand the situation, Plains and Tri-State have indicated their 
intent to close the merger.  Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing 
date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later.  Also,  
until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come 
undone.  If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust 
between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in.  
Has Courtney got this covered?  I suspect he's been thrashing around so much 
on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen.  

I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a 
favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and 
the merger closing.  (the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was 
about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  Also, we 
ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for 
us if the merger goes south for some reason.  I drafted a letter  awhile back 
that could be updated for this purpose.  Susan, assuming Steve and company 
agree, could you follow up on this (I'm having Martha email it to you).  The 
contract requires us to notify ECS by March 1.  Thanks.  DF

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF

Tino, attached is a spreadsheet with the info I think you need.  I got the 
publication wrong--its "Megawatt Daily" that posts daily prices.  Hope this 
is helpful.  DF 

Drew,

Attached is an excel file which contains pricing for the following delivery 
points January 1, 1999 through 
April 30, 2000:

 Four Corners
 Palo Verde
 Mead Nevada
 Southwest Power Pool

Let me know if you want any additional information.  We can get April 30, 
2000 to present information.  I just
have to call RDI--they put it out by quarter so at the end of July we will 
get the next disk.  They'll send me the
data if we need it.

In case you haven't already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two 
year anniversary with the company.   The good Lord willing (and with Stan's 
and Mike's continued acquiescence) I may even surpass the tenure of my two 
most recent and very illustrious predecessors.  Given your meteoric career 
tracks, however, I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge 
accomplishment.  Hope all goes well with you both.  Adios from the big O.

As you requested, following are the facts for the media regarding the 
negotiated rate deals that TW has recently done at rates in excess of the 
tariff max rate.   Please note that the first two transactions are already 
public and the following information can be disclosed now.  The third deal 
has not been filed yet and will not be public until it is.  That filing will 
be made before Dec. 1, 2000. 

General:  TW has done three deals in the last week at rates in excess of TW's 
maximum tariff rate.  Each of the deals was done pursuant to TW's negotiated 
rate authority, which FERC granted TW in 1997.  (Order issued April 11, 1997, 
Transwestern Pipeline Co., 79 FERC Par. 61,021).  Pursuant to that authority, 
TW has filed negotiated rate tariff sheets with the FERC, which are docketed 
at Docket No. RP97-288.  Details on the specific transactions are as follows:
  
Deal 1:  Counterparty:  PG&E Energy Trading
 Rate Schedule:  ITS-1
 Volume:    30,000/day
 Rate:  $.90/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges
 Term: the one day period of November 15, 2000
 Receipt points:  NNG Halley, West Texas Pool
 Delivery point:  SoCal Topock

Deal 2:  Same as Deal 1,  except term is one day period of November 16, 2000 
and rate is $.75/MMBtu  

Deal 3:  Counterparty:  Sempra Energy Trading
 Rate Schedule:  LFT
 Volume:  10,000/day
 Rate:  $1.00/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges
 Term:  Dec. 1-Dec. 31, 2000
 Receipt point:  Bloomfield
 Delivery point:  PG&E Topock

All of the above information is contained in TW's FERC filings on these 
transactions.  No other information is available as TW does not comment on 
specific customer transactions.

Here is the draft letter agreement.  We are still discussing it with ECS and 
can make whatever changes are appropriate.  Note that the letter agreement 
ties back to Article 6 of the Compression Services Agreement.  That article, 
you may recall, is where ECS agreed to create a computerized system that 
would monitor Continental Divide's electric system utilization and warn when 
their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor 
offline (subject to manual override) so we and ECS could avoid peak period 
demand charges.  Instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned 
out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ECS is going to pay us a monthly fee 
to monitor CD's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off 
line.  The load management service has to do with operational management of 
the load we place on CD's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas 
transportation or storage service.  Note that the service goes on for 10 
years (as required by the accountants' 10 year amortization rule) and thus 
may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in TW's 2007 
rate case.  Any way to avoid that?  DF

Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any 
ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad.  
In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter.  Apparently, a bunch of 
utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to 
figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative.  If the RR owns 
its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be 
able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate.  In other words, 
the RR would be treated just like any other landowner.  If we did that, Dave 
thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war.  Since our lines cross or 
parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that 
would be foolish.  

I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was 
interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW 
without too much pain.  If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to 
suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this.  Assuming we 
can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the 
appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW 
should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we 
decide to go forward.   

Other than the BNSF issue, I don't think we have any specific "to dos" or any 
specific comeback date to Dennis and Tino.  So what do you guys think should 
happen next?  DF

Three to-dos on our Mavrix meeting:
1.  Follow up and make sure the officers get set up correctly.
2.  Talk to Perry Frazier in planning--he is keeping copies of the actual EBB 
postings showing that we have had the Ignacio-Thoreau piece of capacity 
posted (the 33,000/d).  I'd like you to keep copies of those postings in your 
file until Mavrix actually buys that capacity.  If we end up in a fight at 
some time, we'll be able to prove the postings were out there, because the 
actual postings are not electronically archived, I am told.
3. All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you, Susan.  For 
now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes.  For 
Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures 
and MKM's group and I should be advised as a matter of course.

Here's the latest Tino-gram:
1.  Tino's environ. consultants have not discovered any stop signs.  

2.  The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant 
as well as the pipeline.  The power plant could be located on Isleta land 
adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation.  Thus, the power 
plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without 
ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land.  PNM would not be necessary to move 
power to DOE.  Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant 
optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.  (maybe  this 
could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia 
reservation?)

3.  Dennis is using Jim Slattery, an ex law partner of mine in DC (and ex 
Dem. U.S. Congressman from Kansas), as his primary contact with  Bill 
Richardson at DOE.  My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship 
with Richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective.  Tino reports 
that "DOE is OK with the deal" and the next step is negotiating the power 
contract itself.  Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the 
project will not come from the tribe so the tribe's interest will be fairly 
thin.   It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery 
promised DOE.

4.  Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says 
he's working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen.  Tino thinks he's 
working for the Laguna tribe, but wanted us to find out who is planning a big 
power plant out there.  Is this ours?  PNM's?  El Paso?  

Finally, the next key step is obviously the economics.  Based on what Tino 
told me, I'm convinced that Dennis and Tino don't have a real good sense of 
how much $$$ might be in this deal.  They are groping a bit and our initial 
analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight.  How are those 
efforts coming?  

Thanks.  DF    
4.

In case you haven't done it already, please cross out the note on your 
calendar that today is the day the Conoco trial starts!  What better day to 
announce a celebration of the settlement, since without it many of us would 
be sitting in a courtroom in Midland wondering whether the trial would last 3 
weeks or 30.   With that image firmly in mind, please plan on joining us for 
a celebratory dinner on Thursday, August 17th at 6:00 at Brennan's.  Again, 
thanks for all of your  efforts on this case, and I hope to see you on the 
17th!  DF

Got a call from Dennis out of the blue this afternoon.  He's pretty gung ho, 
and also alluded to several other projects he's got on the front burner 
(gas-fired power deals).  He had met again with some DOE folks in DC about 
the power contract and feels it is 70-80% locked in.  Have you ever known a 
project developer who would admit to less than 70-80% odds???  I look forward 
to talking on Tuesday.  DF

A couple of issues strike me as particularly important to report on tomorrow: 
(1) the TW train wreck--possible insurance coverage and strength of any claim 
against the railroad.  We ought to talk to Lou to make sure we have the 
latest info as I haven't talked to him since Thursday.  (2)  Status of 
possible litigation involving OneOk.  I don't think anyone has reported to 
Stan on the threatening noise from ONeOk about Praxair's rejection of the 
OneOk force majeure letter.  I'm sure MKM (or Dan on her behalf) will report 
that we are getting the strangers contract ready to send out, but she may not 
mention the Winston conversation with Charlie Graham.  I'll check the bullets 
again to see if anything else jumps out.  Talk to you at 8:30.  DF

company this morning and they are going to cough up some serious insurance

Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law 
bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
matter.  DF

For those of you who didn't have the patience/patriotism to listen to your 
president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a 
highlight:  Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic 
development on the reservations.  Langley may be onto something.  If he/we 
can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may 
be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere.  I'm thinking of tribal 
lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc.  Perhaps Bill should call 
Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides.  Notice that I'm not 
volunteering to make that phone call. DF

I had an interesting conversation with Mark Courtney today, this time about 
something that doesn't cost us money.  He has gained a good bit of experience 
on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric 
contract negotiation.  His take on transmission constraints is consistent 
with what Kevin and I had suspected:  Alb. is a load pocket and the 
prevailing flow is west to east into Alb.  Constraints only affect west to 
east flows and a generator in Alb. could always move power to four corners by 
displacement.  Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve 
Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines 
that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb.  If we are not 
talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to.

Are we still considering adding ETS-owned generation at one or more of the TW 
compressor stations in Arizona or NM?  In case that is still a possibility, 
let me pass on something we may want to follow up on.  I called an old law 
partner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business 
this week to have lunch and catch up.  This guy says he has come up with a 
good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap.  He's got an 
80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development 
in Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in 
service on July 1.  Pretty quick work compared to other projects I've seen.  
Here's his racket:

1.  He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained.  His 
Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from 
Tokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in 
typical electric utility gold plated style).  He didn't say, but I suspect 
there is no warranty on the units.  Obviously, this isn't a bold new 
strategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used 
equipment.

2.  His siting/permitting strategy is to use "brownfield" sites--i.e., 
existing industrial or utility infrastructure is there along with some 
existing air emissions sources.  His Utah site is at the Magnesium Corp. of 
America plant on the Great Salt Lake. Magcorp is an ex-client of mine and I 
know it is a huge emissions source and has no Nimby issues.  Our compressor 
sites, in contrast, are not major emissions sites but may have some other 
things in common with this strategy.

3.  Here's a mysterious one--he says the financing is backstopped by the site 
owner (Magcorp in his project, potentially us if we do a TW project) but the 
corporate structure he has designed results in the power plant being treated 
as a non-controlled, non-affiliated entity for air permitting purposes.  That 
means the power plant emissions are not treated as part of the same emissions 
source as the host/site.  I'm not sure how/whether this works in a TW 
scenario, but it might be worth looking at.  We'd need to make sure that any 
power plant deal we chase doesn't screw up the timetable on the RedRock 
expansion application at FERC.  MKM--if we could preserve the "separate 
source" concept for air permitting purposes, could we even start work on 
developing a power project soon or would we be better off to wait until we 
have a FERC certificate in hand??       
    
Let me know if there is anything worth pursuing on this.  I'm having lunch 
with this guy on Mon. and will probably learn more.  The thing he is proudest 
of is that given the low permitting cost and relatively cheap cost of 
installed capacity, the project is expected to pay for itself in TWO MONTHS 
and then generate 100% upside.  Sounds good to me if its real.  DF

There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the 
close of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial 
thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  

Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were 
certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction 
is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an 
alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements 
for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are 
executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it 
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. 
app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given 
the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to 
sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the 
capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a 
combination of both.  

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options 
(to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or 
whatever number we decide on)
 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly 
this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and 
fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for 
1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve 
Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated 
rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach 
could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking 
our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a 
7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be 
a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a 
customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for 
the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options 
of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this is 
sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure.  

Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility do 
we have in structuring the options?  

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose 
to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to 
be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at 
$.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have 
discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we 
can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better 
deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we 
deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by 
offering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and 
$.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to 
obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.            

Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???

A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it 
the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, 
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d 
of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want 
option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That 
really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand 
first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else?  
Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be 
deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may 
be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the 
recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the 
neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective 
nondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh. 

Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered 
already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are 
easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your 
convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get out 
and sell this stuff.  DF

I got a call from Tino Monaldo today passing on the results of Dennis 
Langley's meeting with DOE in Albuquerque.  DOE indicated that their current 
PNM rate is "5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge."  Tino's consultant 
claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of 
approximately 7 cents/KWh.  Assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the 
current rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/KWh.  This is at the high end of the 
range we hoped they'd be in.

Additionally, DOE indicated that they need "redundancy" and don't want to 
rely on PNM for back up power.  They want a multiple turbine facility--i.e., 
more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines.  The new pipeline will 
need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse 
supplies and guard against supply failure.  They have not asked for fuel oil 
backup.  

I know this is starting to look like the project that won't go away, but the 
power price number looks very promising to me.  I think its worth scrubbing 
down the model we've used to replace the generic capital cost and O&M 
assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine 
configuration we'd be using.  

If this price is really as favorable as I think, can we make another run at 
the ENA people and Federal Solutions guys to see if they have any interest?

A couple of additional thoughts on this morning's conversation: 
 
1.  if we really think the next 6 or 8 months will sort out the takeaway and 
receipt point capacity issues, why not bet the whole farm and try to hold 
onto the whole 150 mm/d until next winter or fall and see if the perceived 
value goes up?  We could tell Calpine "no" on their bid and hold them off for 
several months "negotiating" if that's what we thought would lead to the best 
value.  I don't personally think this would be a prudent approach, but its 
where our logic leads in the extreme, so we'd better be prepared to explain 
why getting the bird in the hand from Calpine is smart.  

2.  We'll research the question of whether we can reject any recourse bids 
that come in over the next 6-8 months if we decide to hold onto the 60 mm/d 
for awhile.  I've thought about it a bit more and I'm pretty sure you're not 
going to like the answer.  First, FERC says we've got to have a recourse rate 
in place for all capacity, new or old.  One reason is that there needs to be 
a max rate that applies to long term capacity releases.  We have the option 
on new projects to go with the existing max tariff rate or a new 
incrementally designed rate.  We are going with the existing tariff rate on 
RedRock.  Fine, but that makes the existing rate the recourse rate for all 
purposes.  FERC's logic will be that TW could sell all of the RedRock 
capacity at recourse rates (currently $.38) and never suffer a revenue 
shortfall even if future rate cases reduce TW's overall rates, because the 
costs of all TW's facilities--including the new project--will be considered 
in the next rate case.  Think about it--our rates will only go down in the 
future if the ENTIRE cost of service goes down.  We'd never "lose money" on 
RedRock, but we might not make as much as we could have made with an 15 year 
fixed $.38 negotiated rate.

There is another  approach.  We could have Mavrix submit a binding bid right 
now for the 60 mm/d and just flat out sell it to them.  That would send a 
pretty strong signal to the market that we are serious about deadlines.  The 
downside of that aggressive approach is that it would get us into the same 
mess that El Paso finally got themselves out of, with Amoco, Dynegy and the 
whole gang beating the crap out of us.  I'm not to fired up about this 
approach for that reason.  I'll give you a call Monday after I've picked our 
best regulatory brains on these issues.  DF

I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on 
the $200k we think they owe us.  Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday 
with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this.  If 
I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and 
delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS' 
fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December .  That 
argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of 
warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?  At 
minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to 
get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied.  But we heard nothing.  Is 
that our story?  

If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking 
to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done.

Hey Eva,

Sorry for the delay, but it has been absolutely nuts lately.  I think the 
smallest move we have had in the last 2 weeks was 30 cents.  Not to mention 8 
of the days were close to or more than $1.00.  Luckily, most of us have been 
on the right side through all this.  And lest I forget about basis.  Demarc, 
Vent, Chicago all up 70 cents.  And PEPL basis trading as high as plus 25 
cents.

Anyway, I am taking a much deserved vacation.  I will be flying to Boston 
tomorrow and coming back on Christmas.  I am looking forward to just hanging 
out with the family and spending time with my nephew.  Let me know if you are 
going to be in Boston during this time. My cell phone number is 713-306-0760.

On a completely different note, we finally got your postcard from Peru.  
Sorry to hear about the backpack fiasco, but it sounds like you had an 
incredible. time.

Looks like its about time to get outta here.  Lots of laundry and packing to 
do.

Hey Eva,

Got your message, was waiting for you to write more.  I'll have to check with 
Sandra, but I haven't heard her say if she got your postcards.  

Robin came back from her honeymoon and you can't tell when she's blushing 
she's so red.  

The last two AGA's have been great.  One was a 40 cent move and the other was 
20 cents (what's better than Wednesdays?).

That's it for now.

Must go see Suey.

- Big Lew

Hey,

I am getting ready to wrap up my work for the night and head over to the 
Williams party.  

I just wanted to send you a quick note so you could have my e-mail address.

I will try to find out more about the rumored buyout.

Talk to you later,


Andy

Hey,

It has been awfully busy now that I'm managing both Gas Daily and 
Mid-continent Basis.  Luckily, the market has settled down and given me a 
chance to get up to speed.

Needless to say, I haven't been to any happy hours either.  I did get to go 
to an Astros game with Natsource a few weeks ago, however.  If I hear of 
anything I will let you know.

Anyway, looks like it's about quitting time.  


- Andy

P.S.  Feel free to call me direct anytime for quotes.

I agree.  My notebook shows ENA selling 2/Month APR - JUL Nymex @ 5.28.

To whom it may concern:

I am disappointed by the lack of internet options.  For someone like myself 
that lives in an apartment, it looks like it will be impossible to get high 
speed internet access.  Perhaps you would consider cutting a deal with OpTel, 
since they provide high speed internet access to every apartment in Houston.

Thank you for time,

Andy

Derek,

Attached is the document I prepared on GMI.  The areas that I could not find 
data for I have left blank .  If you could also check the accuracy of the 
information I have already filled in, I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Andy

Hey,

How was your Christmas?  Did you guys get hammered with snow and ice?

My vacation was very relaxing, and I managed to leave just before the real 
cold weather set in.  It also looks like I'm going to miss the biggest snow 
storm of the winter by about five days.  

I'm still not sure what I am going to do for New Year's eve.  It's been so 
busy this week that I haven't had time to talk to any of my friends.  If you 
hear of anything let me know.

Anyway, since the Nymex closed at Noon, I think I am going to get the heck 
outta here.

Talk to you later.

Andy

To whom it may concern:

First, why does the Dell public website have more choices for upgrades then 
the Enron website?  For example, the website available to the public has a 
19" monitor (M991) for an extra $140.

Second, why is Dell charging Enron employees more for the same products it 
offers to the general public?  For example, the website available to the 
public allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor for $290.  
The Enron website allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor 
for $400.  Therefore, Enron employees are being charged an extra $110 for the 
same upgrade.

I look forward to your response.

What do you mean we're not working hard enough?

You're the one that is never in the office when I call.  Not to mention all 
those stories Nicole told me about you partying it up in San Francisco.

You know what they say:  All play and no work out west makes the stock price 
go south.

It's really me!!!!

Where are you nowadays?

Where have you been?

What have you seen?

Inquiring minds want to know!

I don't know if you have corresponded with Flet lately, but he is officially 
a short timer.  Looks like he's the proud owner of Midwest Power now that 
John Z. has taken off for the Great White North (Calgary).

On a completely different note, Sandra is still waiting for her postcards.  
Apparently you promised to send a postcard every week or something.

Oh, by the way, Martin and Kevin are officially married now.  And Robin is in 
Toronto awaiting the fateful day.

That's about all for now.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Vicky,

Sounds like they've been working you to hard.  You certainly deserve a 
vacation.  I would like to hear about your adventures overseas.  My address 
is as follows:


   Andy Lewis
   3131 Timmons Ln
   Apt. 1010 
   Houston, TX  77027



I got a letter from Diem with their new London address.  I figure I'll give 
them a month or so to move in  before I look into visiting.  Of course, 
getting time off in this job is easier said than done.  Anyway, enjoy your 
trip, and I look forward to hearing from you.

-Andy

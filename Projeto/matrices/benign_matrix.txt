Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n\nExcessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\n\nSolution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=\n a=20\nstep in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20\ndesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20\nmonopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=\nhe=20\nelimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20\n1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=\n=20\nCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=\ne=20\nthe risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20\noffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=\nf=20\ndistributed generation.\n=20\nExcessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20\ninvestor-owned and municipal utilities\n\nSolution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =\na=20\nstep in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20\ninterconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=\n=20\nrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\ngeneration.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\n=20\ninterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\n=20\nthrough executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20\npossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\ne=20\nutility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20\naccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\nDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\n or=20\ngreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\nd=20\ntherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\ngeneration faces. =20\n\nSolution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=\n=20\nD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\n=20\noutput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=\nities.=20\nIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\n=20\nface local opposition.

Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\n=20\nElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\n\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\n=20\nsuppliers.\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\ne=20\ngoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\n=20\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\nWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\nredit=20\nrisk concerns.\nEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\n=20\nis working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\n=20\nboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\n=20\ngoing forward.\n\nSummary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\nThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\ncharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=\n=20\nanalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\nCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =\nAs=20\nsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\nes=20\nadequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\n=20\nUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\n=20\n=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\nuse to=20\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\nee=20\nto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\n=20\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\n=20\nAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\n=20\nRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\n=20\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\n=20\nthe specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\noy to=20\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\ns=20\nextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\nre=20\nDWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\nis=20\ndifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\n=20\nrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\n=20\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\n=20\nsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\n=20\nfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\n\nWe have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\nsk=20\nissues.  We have identified three options:\n\nAmend AB1X\nThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\n=20\nPUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\nred by=20\nDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\nto=20\nensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=\n=20\npreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\n=20\nchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20\nentitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n\nClarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\nthrough Contract Language\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\nre=20\ntime to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=\n=20\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\n=20\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20\n=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n\nMake Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\nAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\ncept=20\nother forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=\n=20\ncash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=\n=20\nindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\n=20\nprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\n=20\ncontract amendments.\n\n4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n\nBoth the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\nAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\n=20\nshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=\nr=20\nonly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=\nl=20\ncredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\n=20\nof 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\nlikely. =20\n\nCEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\nsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\nestimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\n well=20\nbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\nn=20\nin the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\n=20\nthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\nunpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\no=20\ndate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\nhe=20\nflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\nCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\nthis=20\nrequirement. =20\n\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=\n=20\ndraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California\'s seve=\nre=20\nsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\n=20\nnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\nutilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\nt=20\npace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\n=20\nadded to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n\nCERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\n=20\nrolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20\noptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\n=20\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=\n=20\nshould view the CEC\'s "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.\n\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\n=01,s=20\nElectricity Crisis\n\nThis email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=\nl=20\ndeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\n=20\nbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n\nAs we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California\'s=20\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\n\nIncrease supply\nDecrease demand\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n\nIncrease supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\n=20\nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\n=20\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n\nThe Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\nslation=20\nare steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\nse=20\nefforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\n=20\nin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\nrequirements included in the CEC\'s certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=\n=20\nproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\ntransfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20\ninnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\nemissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\nir=20\ndistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\nrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\n\nDecrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\nBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\n=20\nthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\n=20\nbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=\nst=20\neffectively and quickly in two ways:\n\nBuy-down demand\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\nd=20\nto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=\n more=20\neconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\nld=20\nbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\n=20\nthrough the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20\ndetermine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20\nparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20\nnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20\nreductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=\neal=20\nBench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\n\nUse Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\nTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n\nAn internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\n=20\nfor hour-ahead power in real time.=20\nReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=\n=20\nverification.\nSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=\n=20\npaid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\n\nThe potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\ne:\n\n=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=\ncularly=20\nin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=\n=20\nresources.\nreduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20\nelectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =\nin=20\nthe state.\nfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=\nk=20\nof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20\ncustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=\n=20\nresponding.=20\n\nWe estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=\n=20\nexcess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=\n=20\nsummer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=\n=20\nthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=\ns=20\nthat amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20\ndirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20\ncontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\n\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=\ncle:=20\nSB27X\nThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=\nre=20\ncustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=\n=20\nservice providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=\n=20\ncustomers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=\ne=20\nprohibition against Direct Access.\n\nEnron\'s legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=\n=20\ndirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=\nf=20\nWater Resources\' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=\n=20\ncustomer migration. =20\n\nIn addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=\n=20\nthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=\nnt=20\nis not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20\ncondition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20\ntherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20\nfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20\nnon-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=\nia=20\nshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =\nin=20\nwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=\n=20\nof utility load.\n\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =\nvehicle:=20\nAB18X\nUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=\n. =20\nIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20\nimbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=\n=20\nand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=\nia=20\nState government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=\ned=20\nperiod of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\ne=20\nin California\'s energy markets and the private sector\'s willingness to=20\nparticipate in that market.\n\nCalifornia can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\n=20\nseries of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20\nincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=\n=20\n=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=\nould=20\namortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=\nd. =20\nIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=\n=20\nFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20\nrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =\nAB=20\n1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=\neceived=20\nfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=\ne=20\naccrued due to the retail price cap.\n\n \n\n', 1], ['Appointments Week of August 28, 2000', 'text/plain', 'I seem to have three appointments next week:\n\nTuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)\n\nWednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)\n\nThursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)\n\n\nI plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take \nawhile.\n\nRosie\n\n', 1], ['Itinerary', 'text/plain', "Eric, sorry for the delay.

Sorry, the complaint \nform wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the\nform is the same that hired there ticketing help.\n\n-E\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful \nexcept for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  \n\nI was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for \nPhoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride \n(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the \nflight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because \nof foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for \nthis; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of \nthe danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no \ndanger involved in taking off in these conditions, which \nleads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was \nless than helpful in re-routing us on another airline \n(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us \nto Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that \nwe could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible \nto find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this \nconnection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on \nflights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  \nIt now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my \nvacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  \nI am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed \nour connection we were forced to spend a combined \n6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, \nCO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead \nof arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten \nhours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of \nvacation.

Workers are bringing their\n pets to the office. \n\n Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has \nbeen taking his golden retriever,\n Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early \nShow and talked with Co-Anchor\n Jane Clayson. \n\n The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. "He brings a lot of \nemotion and people love it. He\'s\n very relaxed." \n\n But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to \nthe office if he wishes. Not\n everybody can bring their pet to work. \n\n "A lot of it depends on the dog," says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not \na rowdy dog. \n\n "He just hangs out," explains Paucek. "He\'s easy to get along with." \n\n Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, "My wife \nbrings him in and drops him off at\n the office," Paucek says. \n\n While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also \nmany legal issues to consider. John\n Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend \nof bringing pets to the work\n place is really growing. \n\n "More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their \nworking place\n employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace," \nsays Challenger \n\n He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and \nemployees need to explore before\n they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy. \n\n "One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a \npolicy like that, is take a poll\n of their employees and find out what they\'re thinking. If you have certain \nemployees that don\'t feel\n comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy." \n\n There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be \nliable if a dog or cat bites or\n scratches another employee. \n\n "The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of \npolicy in effect," says\n Challenger. "The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites \nsomeone or the cat scratches\n someone, it can\'t be the company\'s fault." \n\n Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office. \n\n "Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, \nwill you put them in a\n certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? \nMany don\'t feel\n comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats \nand dogs and what\n about birds? What about the noise of birds?" \n\n Paucek admits that when there\'s more than one pet in the office, "It gets \nchaotic." \n\n In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners. \nThey found that: \n\n      21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work \n      76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they\'re on the \njob \n      33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals\n\n\n If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should: \n\n      poll employees before they let the pets come \n      provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome \nin the office \n      establish an off-limits-to-pets area \n      make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated \n      bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office \n      tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times\n\n\n If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should \nmake a rotating schedule. \n\n When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it\'s great.

The region is in a delicate supply/demand \nbalance, with most sub-regions of the West relying\n     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak \ncapacity requirements. Because demand growth is\n     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more \nextreme over the next two years.\n     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive \nyear of above-average hydroelectric generation\n     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again \nmask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in\n     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, \nthe West will find itself at an even greater risk of\n     price spikes.\n     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and \n2000, the result of both higher regional spot\n     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the \nvalue of ensuring reliability for consumers. \n\nThe study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and \nhighlights the following key results: \n\n     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand \ngrowth is strong, creating a long-term regional\n     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a \nserious economic downturn in the region.\n     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices \nis for negative real growth through 2010, but\n     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market \ninstitutions continue to evolve and new supply is\n     slowly added over the next few years.\n     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue \nto rise (but still remain below many other\n     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.\n     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power \ngeneration is poised to more than double by 2010,\n     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest \nsubregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas\n     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if \nany, real price appreciation through 2010. \n\n``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the \nother five regional volumes, offers\ncomprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power \nmarkets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the\nICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic \ncapabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the\nfundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from \nworking one- on-one with the market's key\nplayers.''\n\nAbout the ICF 1999 Bulk Power Outlook\n\nICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, \nan authoritative assessment of North American\nregional bulk power markets through 2010.

Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the \nwood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure \nregarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose \nfolkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the \nsecond part).\n\nThe prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective \naccommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual \nhallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through \ntheir cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head \ncoverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness \nwhen upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such \na cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from \nmy place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.\n\nHastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this \nfenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected \nas it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be \nsaid to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my \nincredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered \nconveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,  \npiloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it \nbecame instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. \nWith his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more \nvertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly, \nexpelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of \nthe octet by his or her respective cognomen -  "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et \nal. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through \nwhich structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the \n32 cloven pedal extremities.\n\nAs I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a \n180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity \nand via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad \nentirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of \ncarboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His \nresemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of \nassorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.\n\nHis orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary \ndermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The \ncapillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with \nblood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the \ncoloration of Albion\'s floral emblem,  the latter that of the Prunus avium, \nor sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much \nas a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared \nlike small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.\n\nClenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, \nforming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative \nseasonal circlet of holly.  His visage was wider than it was high, and when \nhe waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the \nmanner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in \nshort, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the \noptical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every \neffort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one \neyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that \ntrepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, \nhe commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the \naforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned \npreviously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this \ntask, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in \nlateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in \na gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating \n(in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector \nonto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his \ncontracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded \nto soar aloft in a movement  hitherto observable chiefly among the \nseed-bearing portions of a common weed.

Attendees from \nDynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy\'s head of trading), Matt (whose last \nname I didn\'t get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.  If you think somebody \nelse should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I \ncan talk to Harlan.  Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an \ninternal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet \nwith Dynegy.\n\nAs you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively \nwith a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product \nis.  Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against \nthey way the product ultimately got defined.  Dynegy put on a big dog and \npony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that \nEEI\'s Into product was flawed.   Their position, while not completely \nexpressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are \nmaking deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be \nexcused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in \ngeneral, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another \ninterface unless the cut was due to Buyer\'s use of non firm transmission when \nfirm was available or due to Buyer\'s attempt to move the energy away from the \nreceiving control area).  Dynegy\'s approach was driven by the fact that they \nhave extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go \nphysical.  At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in \nfirm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent \nproduct.  Dynegy\'s concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.\n\nI hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:\n\n1.  Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition \n- Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.  We \ntrade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common \nunderstanding of what we are trading.  Critical to clear up this ambiguity.\n\n2. Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against \nEEI\'s Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost \nacceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice \nagainst the Into definition.\n\n3. Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what \nwill happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is \nsuch an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally \nwe all agree how it should operate. Additionally, it is critical that we \nstart thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in \ntransmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may \nwant to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes \ninto an RTO)\n\nCall me with any questions/thoughts.\n\nThanks\nElizabeth\n 36349\n\n', 1], ["A Midwesterner's view", 'text/plain', 'Chi is now confused.

At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed  \na $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected \nreceivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had \nwith PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract \nprovided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) \nand some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still \na $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the \ncurrent bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any \nadditional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the \nbankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to \nother creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other \ncreditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment \nthat provided us a significant offset to the receivable).\n\nAccordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell \nher to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the \nunlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such \namounts received from PCA back to you. \n\nCall me if you have any questions.\n\nThanks\nElizabeth \n713 853 6349\n\n", 1], ["RE: Sam's birthday", 'text/plain', "Doing much, much better, thanks.

All of you should have \nreceived a black binder labelled "Analysis of ECT\'s Finacial, Power, Gas \nForms"  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as \nsuch forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to \nhow each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, \nassignement, confidentiality ....).  If you did not receive or cannot locate \nthis binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.  This \nanalysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have \nchanged since then but have not undertaken to "update" the memo as we will be \nable to discuss such changes at the meeting.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based \ntrading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences.  \nThe ultimate goal is to determine what Enron\'s "model" trading provisions \nshould be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified \nrational for treating the commodities in a different manner.  With this in \nmind, I would hope to be able to create a "modular type" contract  whereby \neach legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language \nthat will be approved by the group.  By way of example, Enron\'s gas contract \nprohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any \nreason.  The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably \nwithhold its consent.  At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred \napproach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, \nwhich language would be approved at a seperate meeting.  This  "modular \nassignment section" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless \ndifferences were required due to the commodity/product involved.\n\nYou will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas \nof a trading contract.  Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with \nother provisions such as credit terms.  At the meeting, I hope to further \ndiscuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.\n\nAron Roffwarg, a lawyer  from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to \nassist us in this effort.\n\nThanks \n\n\n\n\n', 1], ["Re: It's Official", 'text/plain', 'Thanks for this - as you suggested earlier when I get a break I will \nfollow-up on your earlier email, re WEST TEAM with Carol as support, and send \nout another email. \n\n', 1], ['Re: Law Conference Information -- PLEASE READ', 'text/plain', 'Sara \n\n I need to cancel my reservation for Wed. night.

Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\n"Traders do that all the time; they\'re looking forward," said William Burson, \na trader. "It makes the market for natural gas." \n\nBut the market\'s response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation\'s director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\n"It\'s a little frustrating that they don\'t take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting," McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \nfingers at Wall Street. \n\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\'s speculators for \nthe rise in gas prices. \n\n"It\'s my firm belief ... that today\'s gas prices are being manipulated," Adik \ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \n\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \n\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \nfor this winter\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \n\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \nprices before they soared. \n\n"We\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul \nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \n\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \n\n"There\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \nchange," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \n\n\nHot topic \n\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \nmany circles, little else is discussed. \n\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \nprevious December\'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n"It\'s the talk of the town here," he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn\'t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\'t make it worthwhile \nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \ncustomers. \n\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \nfor winter. \n\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \nmarkets. \n\n"It\'s all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \ncommodity in the world. \n\n\nSetting the price \n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \nwidespread influence over gas prices. \n\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \n\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \nof natural gas. \n\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\'t need to \nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\'re trading. Like all \nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \ntheir volatility and to the traders\' ability to make or lose a lot of money \nin a short time. \n\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association\'s \nweekly storage numbers. \n\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \nneed in the winter. \n\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \nhopes that the summer\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \nsufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \nassociation\'s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n\nBut some utility executives didn\'t share that view. William Eliason, vice \npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December\'s cold snap had \ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n\n"I was getting worried," he said. \n\nThen suddenly the market turned when January\'s weather turned warmer. \nWednesday\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n\n\nJust passing through \n\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \npass their fuel costs on to customers. \n\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers\' cost-of-gas \ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \nenergy. \n\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \n\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \ncosts. \n\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy\'s gas purchasing practices. \n\n"Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. "It\'s time to consider \nsome changes." \n\n\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \nseverly@kcstar.com. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star  \n\n', 1], ['Re: your moms birthday', 'text/plain', 'mac,\n\nWe will be there on the 9th and I will bring the paperwork.\n\nphillip\n\n', 1], ['Re: Please respond', 'text/plain', 'message board\n\n', 1], [None, 'text/plain', 'Dave,\n\nThe back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars \nthat is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped \nfrom the Office of the Chairman.

Brett also \nforwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse.  The \ncorrespondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings \nconducted between Enogex and Wildhorse.  No demands were made by Enogex and \nno claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse.  Brett stated that the \nEntrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because \nthe downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications.  \nEnogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or \nQuestar.  I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release \nthe gas.  He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo \nnegotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse.  \n\n2.  I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa.  Nothing really \nuseful.  There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area \ncalled Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought \nthese assets were in a state of economic viability decline.  Unfortunately \nthis letter was not directed to Enogex.  However, the draft letter takes that \nposition with Wildhorse.\n\n3.  I am securing local consul out of Denver.

Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the \ndeclaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse.  \n\nThis draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas.  However, to \nreiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right \nto deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement.

Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if \naccepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can \nargue impossibility of performance.

Commercial \nand regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, \nDynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the \nproposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a \nsummary of the comments.\n\nMarketing affiliate concerns.  BP\'s regulatory representative expressed \nconcern that TW\'s marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game \nthe system.  In BP\'s example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA \ncould purchase an "out of the money" call option essentially cost free, since \nits affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds \nfrom ENA\'s ability to then "move the market" through the establishment of the \nlong basis position would go directly to Enron\'s bottom line.  BP suggested \nthat TW\'s marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the \nmarketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to \nother shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern\'s prior dealings with \nENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW\'s filing will set a precedent for \nother pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first \npipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW\'s program to be as restricted as \npossible.  Dynegy echoed BP\'s concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but \nrather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier \nsuggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference \nbetween the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if \nthe affiliate\'s bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  \n\nTW\'s response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a \nmarketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable \nrecord in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has \ncomplied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale \nof capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily \ninclude any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have \nserious concerns regarding the Commission\'s overall policy on marketing \naffiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that \napplies to all interstate pipelines.\n\nRight of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the \nright of first refusal.  TW\'s  response was that ROFR will still be available \npursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.\n\nNegotiated rate.  BP\'s representative claimed that option contracts will \nconstitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as \nsuch.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW\'s \nposition at this point is that since the option fee is part of the \ntransportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment \nwill only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the \noption fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  \n\nHoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso \nas an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program \nwould make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why \nsome of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would \ncreate more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps \nbecause the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the \nunderlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make \nhoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for \nwithholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC\'s current policy \nagainst reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to \nplacing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for \ncapacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require \nTW to do so in a final order.\n\nOur plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of \nSeptember 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC \nfiling by mid-September.\n\n\n\n', 1], ['draft of options filing', 'text/plain', "Take a look at the attached and let's talk tomorrow if at all possible.

In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.  \nIn Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  "The \nCommission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season \nprovisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid \nevaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing \ndifferent non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different \ntransactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology \nbefore the bidding process begins."  The only problem is I am not sure we \nhave that "flexibility" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post \na different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some \nlanguage allowing us to do so.\n\nI have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what \nyou write I\'d be happy to.\n\n\n', 1], ['Recourse rate dilemma: the sequel', 'text/plain', 'Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...\n\nThe problem:\n\nAs you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the \nfollowing language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern\'s tariff: "if the rate \nbid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be \nthe maximum tariff rate," and the additional frustrating language "[a]ll \navailable capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."  At our \nlast meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could \ncapture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate \nto index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount \nof risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven\'t done any \nindex-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I \nhave been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of \nother ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum \nrate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I\'ve quoted above.  \nHowever, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical \nchange in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW \nlacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.\n\nWhy the problem exists (you may already know):\n\nSteve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in \nthe first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the \nCommission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for \nnegotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a \ncost-of-service based tariff rates.  "[T]he availability of a recourse \nservice would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that \nthe customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline \nunilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the \nrecourse rate mitigates market power."  \n\nThe Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest \nrate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its \ntransportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly \nnot limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper \nwilling to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely \nbecause someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  "When there are \nmore requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the \npipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either \nthe negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata \nbasis if required by its tariff."  The example cited by the Commission:  If a \npipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one \nwho is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a \nnegotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata \nbasis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some \nother allocation method such as lottery).  \n\nWhen TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added \nthe statement that "if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the \nrate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."  Presumably we had \nconcluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order \nto receive negotiated rate authority.  \n\nSolutions??\n\nI would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language \noutright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I\'ve really been \nchasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I \nkeep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is \nwhere I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  \nSteve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the \nrecourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still \nhave to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic \nwarns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive \nproposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.\n\nAnother idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more \nthan max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  \nWe\'ve seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more \nthan max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, \ndespite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it\'s unlikely \nwe can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be \nable to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But \nI just am not convinced we could get around the Commission\'s requirement that \nrecourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either \nof you seen anything to the contrary?  \n\nI would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to \ndiscuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to \ndiscuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few \nminutes.

Residential and small commercial users \nwould be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. \nBig users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison\'s debt, but \nsupporters of the plan say it\'s these users that wanted deregulation and \nshould shoulder the costs it created. \n"We\'re trying to put something together in a way that solves all these \nproblems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won\'t solve any \nproblems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). \nAlthough the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis\' proposed deal to put \nEdison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help \nrestore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. \nDemocrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP \nlawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison\'s debt. \nThe plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and \n"noncore" users. \nSEPARATING \'CORE\' USERS\nUnder this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core \nusers would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would \nbe those using more than 500 kilowatts. \nOut of Edison\'s 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. \nBut those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison\'s demand for energy. \nCore customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- \nterm contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar \npanels, on contract with the utility. \nThat would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of \nthe spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of \nelectricity. \nLarge users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to \nbuy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to \nmake themselves energy self-sufficient. \nThe plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy \ncustomers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. \nDuring that period, residential, small business and large industrial users \nwould all share in paying off Edison\'s debt. But in 2003, that burden would \nshift exclusively to the big users. \nRepublican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be \ngiven what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate \ncheaper rates. \nEnron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users \nbecause that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. \nLarge users who want to remain on the grid could do so. \nEDISON \'ENCOURAGED\'\nSources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out \ndetails of the plan. \nA spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks. \n"I haven\'t seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice \npresident with Edison. "They\'re approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and \ntrying to find a solution." \nBig businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there \nis nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. \n"We\'re very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will \nexperience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J. Smith, a \nlobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. \n"When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another \npotentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," \nSmith said. \nAdded Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and \nTechnology Association: "What\'s the rationale for the noncore to be paying \nthe entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. \nThey don\'t want voters to pay because they vote." \nCONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT\nHarvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, \nsaid he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business \ninterests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison\'s debt onto \nresidential and smaller commercial customers. \n"I think it\'s a trick. We\'ve seen this same tactic used at the Public \nUtilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big \nbusiness end up costing more for residential and small businesses," \nRosenfield said. \nThe new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison\'s part of \nthe transmission system that loops electricity around the state. \nDavis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that \nfor the state\'s financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. \nRepublicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state \npurchase of transmission lines. \nIn the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the \ntransmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. \nIn addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to \neither purchase other assets -- such as Edison\'s hydroelectric facilities, \nfor example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants. \nE-mail Greg Lucas at glucas@sfchronicle.com. \n,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:\n\nCustomers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. \n17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt \nfrom paying for the bonds. \n\nIn short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from \ntheir ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services \nfrom their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it \nwouldn\'t be fair to require them to pay for it.\n\nCustomers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but \nsubsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by \nDWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  \n\nFor example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying \npower but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only \nbe responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from \nJan. 17th thru April 30th.\n\nI believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took \nplace over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn\'t explicitly agree during the \ntalks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree \npretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create \nunnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include \nvery clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what \ncustomers\' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.\n\nIn addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with \nincentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it \nfinds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to \nswitch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short \nposition that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby \nreducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity \npurchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.\n\nWith this in mind, I\'m also proposing that the group consider an amendment to \nthe bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches \nto Direct Access by September 1st.\n\nFinally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct \nAccess is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that \nseems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.

Gray Davis faces an \nuncertain future. \nThe bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of \nPalo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility\'s \ntransmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 \nbillion of the utility\'s debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in \ndebt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained \nfrozen. \nThe Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last \nnight, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of \nmistakes that led to California\'s botched 1996 deregulation legislation \nhaunted lawmakers. \nDavis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk \nbefore Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and \nEdison. \nLawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, \nbut failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. \n"It\'s a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior \nto the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. \nDavis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to \niron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that \ncould be accomplished in the next few days. \n"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact \nthat there\'s a bill moving in each house." \nBoth houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to \na floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the \nprocess. \nIn the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats \nand all 13 Republicans voted no. \nSen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its \ncurrent form, but not if any substantial changes are made. \n"The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This \nparticular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to \nprotect ratepayers. I\'m leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being \ncannibalized." \nThe Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off \nalternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off \nthrough increased rates charged Edison\'s largest customers and would not \ncover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. \nEdison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, \nwhich would put it back in the position of buying power. \nThe state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since \nJanuary, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the \nutility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal \nwould be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. \nIn the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change \ntheir bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman \nOaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to \ngarner more support. \nSome of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines \nand taking municipal utilities out of the deal. \nAssemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the \nEdison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. \n"It\'s a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this \ndoes not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say \nI\'m tentatively satisfied." \nAlquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature \nof the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former \nstate senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 \nlegislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. \nAssemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the \nHertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the \nmeasure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. \n"As we\'ve learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. \nI have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very \nlittle gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a \ndeadline, too much gets done." \nHertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was \ngetting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy \ncrisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings \nand countless hearings on the crisis. \nA wild card in the Assembly\'s plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- \nLos Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight \nbailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied \non utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee. \nE-mail the reporters at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com and \nrsalladay@sfchronicle.com. \n,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an \narithmetic exercise by the state power grid\'s traffic controller not intended \nfor a refund proceeding. And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealistic, \nDavis and other state officials insisted on its validity. \n"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a \nbillion dollars," Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed. But \nthat\'s a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due. "If you \nthink California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see \nyou in court," Davis said Tuesday. \nWhy is Davis being so belligerent? Because it\'s good politics. Ever since he \nbegan berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off \nCalifornia, Davis\' approval ratings have been climbing. If he settled for \nsubstantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple \nof billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be \nembarrassed. Politically, he\'s served by continuing to portray himself as \nfighting for California and against the out-of-state generators. \nThat it\'s more political construct than reality is indicated by another event \nthis week, Davis\' release of state power purchase data from early in the year \n-- numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do \nit. \nDavis and his minions have been accusing Texas-based generators and power \nbrokers of particularly egregious price gouging -- clearly playing on \nCalifornians\' instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texan \nGeorge W. Bush is a co-conspirator. But the power purchase records -- which \nwere released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee -- indicate that \nless than 10 percent of California\'s power purchase dollars were going to \nTexas and the private sellers, in general, charged the state less than such \npublicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. \nThe clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that \nundercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not, however, deterring Davis from \ncontinuing to operate, at least for public consumption, in the melodramatic \nvirtual world. \nOne cannot, however, ignore reality forever. The likelihood of a \npro-generator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for \nDavis, or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from \nslipping into bankruptcy court. The Legislature has refused to act on the \nEdison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility\'s \ndebts would be slimmed down by FERC. \nThis week\'s farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will \nstall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the \nutility into bankruptcy court later this summer. That\'s part of that nasty \nold reality that cannot simply be wished away. \n\nThe Bee\'s Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com\n.\n\n\n\n\n', 1], ["Rick's Panel", 'text/plain', 'Plz see email.

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at', 'text/plain', 'FYI.  David Freeman and DWR....public power working for California.\n********************************************************\nPower delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants \nhas been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.\nBy Carrie Peyton\nBee Staff Writer\n(Published July 31, 2001) \nCalifornia is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power \nplants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say. \nThe sporadic episodes haven\'t cost much yet, but they illustrate a \npotentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between \ntwo agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state. \n"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn\'t \nseem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on \nthe governing board of the Independent System Operator. \nThe trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a \nderegulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in \ntheory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state\'s consumers. \nMeanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped \nin to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn\'t bidding at some \nauctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn\'t. \n"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It\'s sort of \nthe worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR. \nISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves \nconfidential bidding behavior. \nBut Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the \nDepartment of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his \nagency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined. \nThe state\'s role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose \ncredit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said. \n"We\'re not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It\'s \nnot necessarily a good fit." \nSome of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines. \nOthers are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing \noutput when demand doesn\'t match forecasts. \nGenerally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a \nprocess the industry calls "decking." \nBut since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly \nthrottled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the \ncheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20 \na megawatt-hour. \nEdison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660 \nmegawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the \nISO\'s behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee. \nThe ISO could probably have saved the state\'s consumers $370,000 at one plant \nif it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of \nMohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said. \nThe amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarming \nthan the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less \nthan it paid, he said. \nIndustry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business \nwhere power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather. \nBy contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for \nno good reason," Florio said. \n"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas \nplants? The answer is, the gas plants aren\'t bidding ... probably because \nthey\'re contracted with DWR," he said. \nFour Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also \nbeen throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said. \nIn addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on \ntransmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO \ninstead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting \ncosts, Florio said. \nFor its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical \ndecisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie \nMcCorkle. \nDWR\'s Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on \nbidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a \nsmoother-running system in place by next summer. \n\n\nThe Bee\'s Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or \ncpeyton@sacbee.com <mailto:cpeyton@sacbee.com>.\n\n', 1], ['Re: FW: RE: Legislative Report (07/05/2001) -- IEP', 'text/plain', "i'd send to the big list.  i used to send what julie malinowski sent around.\n\n", 1], ['Year End Ratings', 'text/plain', "In order for me to effectively represent you at the ETS PRC  and for some of \nyou at the Accounting and Finance PRC's I will need some information from \neach of you.

My husband, Patrick( \nOne Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as \nwell as elite members on several occasions.  We also use Chase Continental \nVisa exclusively, and my husband is a President\'s Club member.  I have made \nContinental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own \ntravel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.  \nThis morning, however, I had a very bad experience.  I booked tickets for a \nvacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on \nDecember 1.  Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from \nmy doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due \nto complications with my pregnancy.  My doctor indicated to me that I may not \nbe able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.  I \nspoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he \nindicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on \nSeptember 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I \nbook a ticket for me or my husband.  I understand that this is the same \npolicy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn\'t feel \nlike taking a vacation this weekend.  In my opinion, this is an unacceptable \npolicy in the event of medical complications.  As you can see with my \nsituation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a \nvacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month \nold child.  I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help \nme or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your \npolicy.  I indicated that I could provide a doctor\'s note if necessary.  He \nwas very rude to me, stating "You don\'t have to ask me 7 different times for \nthe same thing - I already told you NO!"  I had to cancel a flight for work \nabout a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping \nthat I would be able to fly again by now.  For your information, your \ncompetitor was very helpful.  They accepted my doctor\'s note, gave me a \ncredit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another \nperson\'s name if I am still unable to use it.  That ticket was also booked as \na non-refundable fare.  Although I have always used Continental  for my \npersonal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has \ndefinitely made me second-guess my future choices.

The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could \nbe implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is \nimplemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock \nborder and must match up with the intra-state transport.  \n\nSoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock \ndelivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the \ncapapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They \nalso stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum \nof 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if \ntheir volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo \nuntil the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being \nestablished at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.\n\nWilliams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a \nreduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.\n\nAfter much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:\n\nRecommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not \nrelate to receipt point rights.\n\n1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);\n\n2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)\n\n3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or \nEhrenberg.  It is recommended that they\n give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up \nlike amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from \nTopock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.\n\n4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:\n\n   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock\nTexaco   40    135\nBurlington  26    74\nAero   5    15\nBorax   7    12\nLADWP  0    36\nSWGas   0    20\n\n5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:\n\nExpansion Shippers  78000 \nSocal Gas           425000\nBLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 \nEl Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)\nTotal 851000\n540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.\n\nThe producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and \nfelt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off \nthe top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.\n\nSeparate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El \nPaso's counter -proposal.  \n\nProducer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent \nthruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other \nforms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge \nTopock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as \nconverting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the \nproducers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, \nthey would not pay anything.\n\nBlock 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their \ndeals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For \nvolumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric \nrate.\n\nBottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this \ncase.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will \nstudy  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.\n\nAnother topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived \ngaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more \ngas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could \nbe controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  \nEl Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan \nbased on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle \n2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings \nandfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a \ntechnical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets \nresolved.\n\nRegarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the \nkeystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the \nbondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, \nSouthern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you \nadvised of development.

If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, \nmaking the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 \ncent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller \nsize than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower \ndelta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a \nmarket in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the \nmoney.  \nMaybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way \nwrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is \n4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is \n3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a \nstrike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate \nhaving to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.\n\nIn terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles \nstruck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for \nwhat I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying \nto rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier \nfor the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more \nsense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if \nsomeone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to \ncall ENE to close the trade.

The problem with these models is that \nthey are strictly theoretical and don\'t take into account gas fundamental \nprice limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, \nfor a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within \nvariable cost than the models predict.

Since the filing is not required under Order 637,\nColumbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance \nfiling made June 15.\n\n``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party \nthat places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of\nRates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we \nconduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often\nwait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current \nprocess is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the \nauction is\nclosed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''\n\nAccording to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving \nto an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into\nconsideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in \ncapacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term\ncontracts.\n\nUnder Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via \nits electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm \ncapacity.\nCustomers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the \nquantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted\ncapacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if \nColumbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with \na\ndifferent term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a \npresent value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time \nbefore a\nbinding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.\n\nColumbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles \noutlined in FERC's Order 637. \n\n    *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will\n          begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be\n          posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).\n    *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-\n          discriminatory basis.\n    *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing\n          EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be\n          made available on the Internet.\n    *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since\n          bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to\n          each capacity package made available.\n    *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's\n          identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection\n          criteria were applied.\n    *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all\n          bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to\n          all bidders through an Internet-based system.\n\n\n``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity \nauction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all \nparties\nas well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.\n\nLevander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is \nbased on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for\ntransparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to \nwithdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.\n\nColumbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, \nVa., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to\nmarkets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 \nMidwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates one\nof the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 \nbillion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.\n\nColumbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading \nenergy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion.

Being \naware of risk\ndoes not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.\n\nNow a few more detailed comments.\n\n1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined \nwith \na project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view,\nshould be applied to financial options that trade in a market without \nsufficient depth.\nOne should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The \napproach used in valuation\nof the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of \ninvestments in physical\nassets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized \nthrough other aspects\nof valuation technology used in RAROC. \n\nIf we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent \nand use\nthis approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that \nI recommend this course of action).\n\n2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.\n\nLet's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.\n\nHe cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the \nfloor for\nthe valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as \nopposed to taking a vol\nrisk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes \nfuzzy.\nThe option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on \ntwo factors:\n\n1. risk preference\n2. existing portfolio positions\n\nRisk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that \nconsists of two parts:\nexpected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 \nstandard deviations.\nThe number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability \nto absorb the loss.\nI admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We \nlooked into insurance pricing at the\nrequest of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more \nabout it.\n\nExisting portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease \nthe risk of the overall portfolio.\nI would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not \nlook to me as a deal that reduces risk\n(given all our positions in this region).\n\nWhat are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the \nutility function of a decision maker\nin technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary. \n\nIf we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged,\nwe should subtract from the value of the contract\nthe value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value).\nIf we don't price this option explicitly,\nthe valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk \npremium.\n\nIn the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot \nhedge, he should recognize the risk\nof losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of \nthe option.\nHow big is the discount? See the comments above. \n\nIn the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton \nparadigm applies, both values\nwill become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form \nthe point of view of \na seller and a buyer will converge.\n\n3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?\n\nWe can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will \nrecognize the downside and/or\nupside at different points in time in different states of the world).\nIf we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of \nNPV as of today.\nKnowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases \nwe are still holding\nit. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is \nequivalent to using a \ndiscount rate with a risk premium.\n\nI hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a \ndelay in responding\nto this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we \nall agree.\nIt's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not \nhave\ngood answers.\n\n \n\nVince\n\n", 1], [None, 'text/plain', ' Liz Purcell\n\n\n\nPhone: (713) 582 3707\n\n', 1], ['Lunch', 'text/plain', "Bjorn,\n\nLet's meet 11:30 at the lobby.

Historically, we were rather passive customers of\nthe academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our \npresence\non the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.\n\nWe should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get \nthe best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we \nare not\nvery successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses\nand this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:\n\n1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently  \nunderwriting two research\nprojects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor  \nNicholas Bambos\n(a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation\nof the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.\nInvolvement in research projects allows us to obtain \naccess to current scientific developments in the leading universities and \nalso to lock-up some very\npromising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such \nprograms.\n\n2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every \npresentation\nI have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes \nand hiring decisions.\nIt is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic \nprogram. In many cases,\nthe best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach \nthem during their \nsenior years.\n\n3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. \n\nCloser cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to \ngetting the best students\nand obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important \nin shaping public  opinion\non the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of \nderegulation and design of new markets).\n\nCurrently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on \npersonal commitment of a number\nof overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and \nfocus.\n\nI want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) \nresponsible for coordinating\nour relationships with the universities.

Purchase Price:  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbin=\nes=20\n(subject to adjustment as described below). [Adjusted how?  Need specific=\n=20\nreference. Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent=\n=20\nwith the structure?  Definitely sounds like a UCC deal,  for what that=01,s=\n=20\nworth.]\n2.

The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0=\n=20\nmillion down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement=\n=20\nwith ENA providing for the Purchase.

I think the market \nrequires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with \nrespect to transportation constraints.  The market has clearly seen a \ndivergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects.  The \nmarginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has \nproven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting \ndaily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas \nduring these months.  Because of this, supply being transported from the \nSouthwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E.  This places \ndownward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock \ngas.  Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to \nthe border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal\'s \ninterconnects.  Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.   \n\nThere is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of \nliquidity.  Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport \ncontracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets. \nThe market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg.  The overwhelming \ndemand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock.  Although Ehrenberg is the \nmarginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream \ncapacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at \nSocal Topock than at Ehrenberg.  The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf \nof capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.  Ehrenberg \nsimply gets placed at "market prices" because of varying objectives.  One \ntransporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller \nbuyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies.  This \nilliquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg. \n\nPicture  the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha \nbasins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.  Because \nof the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on \nEPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first.  These \nmolecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise, \nall Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery \ninterconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on \nthe SJ east leg of EPNG.  This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas \ngoing into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on \nthe EPNG south mainline.  While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does \nthe EOC demand.  Permian west (Keystone West meter)  cannot satisfy both the \nEOC demand and the Socal demand.  So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG \nWaha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south \nmainline.  This tells the entire story.  When demand exceeds all available \nhistorical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg \ndemand, you have a paradigm shift.   This eliminates any correlation that may \nhave existed between the supply basins and the market area.  When Keystone \nWest reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the \nmax rate transport rate then dies a fast death.  There is simply no available \ncapacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate \ntransport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.  If you asked the market what the \nmaximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not \nknow.  This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are \nabove historical levels.  It is like Al Gore blaming "big oil companies" for \nthe high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity.  There \nsimply isn\'t the capacity to meet demand.  The supply exists, but there isn\'t \nenough refining capacity available to meet demand.  Fundamentals rule the \nmarket in all cases.\n\nI would like to propose the following index points for the Southern \nCalifornia border.  The market would  be better served with supply being \nincluded in these index points.  One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG \nEhrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge.  The market \nwill be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in \nthe future.  We will then address the different interconnects and propose an \nindex for the Socal citygate as well. \n\nCall me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download.\n\nSincerely,   \n\nMike Grigsby\nDirector of West Trading\n713-780-1022\n\n', 1], ['Re: Sailing Update', 'text/plain', 'Yes, I will be out of town on the fourth.

WAR DAMN EAGLE!!\nPL\n\n', 1], [None, 'text/plain', "Great article on what it truly means to be an Auburn Man\n\n\n\n\nThe ties that bind \nFriday night meetings have helped Auburn through hard times\n10/03/00\nBy PHILLIP MARSHALL \nTimes Sports Staff \n\n\nAUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.\n\nFive straight games had been lost. Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as \nhead coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years \nof trouble, despair and losing.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n\nMore Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n''It was defense and offense,'' offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said. \n''Whatever happened, we pointed fingers at each other.''\nOn the Friday night before last November's game against Central Florida, a \nsmall group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback \nHeath Evans. They prayed. They talked about life and the sometimes bitter \nturns it can take.\n\nA bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters \nand reserves. It wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about \nfootball. It was about matters of the heart.\n\n''We may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,'' senior whip \nlinebacker Rob Pate said. ''Since then, it's just like another thing on the \nitinerary. It's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there. \nWe've got five or six coaches. Coach Tuberville comes in there. People just \nlay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds.''\n\nAuburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November \nnight. Players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has \ngrown ever stronger.\n\nIt has carried the 15th-ranked Tigers to a 5-0 record going into Saturday's \nSoutheastern Conference West Division showdown at 20th-ranked Mississippi \nState.\n\nPate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in \nthe most difficult times.\n\nPate knows about pain and even fear. A mysterious disease, now seemingly \nunder control, threatened his senior season.\n\n''When you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you \nfor help, you know everything about a guy,'' Pate said. ''With me, it was my \nhealth. Before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and \nevery guy in there put his hands on me. We said a prayer together. Man, I was \ncrying.\n\n''It's like that every weekend. Somebody on this team is suffering through \nsomething. They share it. When you line up on Saturday, it's a lot easier to \nlook at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got.''\n\nOn the field, there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season. \nTuberville says it started when Auburn players, strengthened by the bad \ntimes, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for \ntheir teammates and their school.\n\n''I've never been around a team this close,'' Tuberville said. ''They get \nalong. We haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys \nurging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to \nget better.\n\n''It's just a special group. They enjoy being around each other and \nunderstand what it's going to take for us to win.''\n\nThe change from not so long ago is striking, Simmons says.\n\n''If you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little \ngroup, things aren't going to work,'' Simmons said. ''If you have trust in \nyour teammates, you can build a good team. Right now, we've got that going.''\n\nIt starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college \nfootball. They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in 1997. Then \ncame two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, Terry Bowden.\n\nThey revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting. They \ntake pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.\n\nNo one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback Ben Leard. He \nwent from starter to third team in 1998, then won his job back in 1999 when \nhardly anyone thought he could.\n\nToday, he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback.\n\n''We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say \n'Man, I'm looking forward to playing in the NFL,' '' Leard said. ''No one is \nworried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise. \nEverybody just wants to win ball games. The relationships we have on this \nteam are like brothers.''\n\nLeard says nothing that happens can change that.\n\n''If we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special \nseasons I've ever had in my life,'' Leard said. ''We've got people excited. \nWe're excited. The fun is back in it for us.\n\n''It's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to \npractice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk. There are no fingers being \npointed anywhere. There are no individuals on this football team.''\n\nEvans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of \nblocker for tailback Rudi Johnson. Every Friday night, Evans is still the one \nwho leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain.\n\n''Heath is just like that all the time,'' Pate said. ''He's a great example \nof somebody who lives what he talks. He's a role model, not just for younger \npeople but for all of us.''\n\n", 1], ['Re: Hi', 'text/plain', 'His name was Keith Corbo.

Issues include salaries of employees hired by \nbuyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees \n(including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for \ndivesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.\n\nCrane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.\n\nFalcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.\n\nE2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.\n\n\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\n\nTriple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition \nissues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by \npersons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not \nto sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.\n\nEast Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many \ntransition issues due to Enron\'s providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP \npersonnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services, \nincluding legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.\n\nCrane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor \nunions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.\n\n\nLitigation\n\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\n\nNo employee-initiated litigation for 2000.\n\nNon-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in \nSharolyn Wood\'s court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.\n\nMinor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement \nfee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered \nmediation to follow.\n\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\n\nI expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, \nas people leave after they are paid their bonuses.  \n\nWe should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.\n\n\n\nDocuments Generated\n\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\n\nNew Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting \nServices Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work \nDescription for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from \noutside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the \nagreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.  \n\nStandard Agreements:\n\nI prepared:\n\n  ___ draft employment agreements.\n\n ___ draft consulting services agreements.\n\n  ___ separation agreement and releases.\n\n ___ retention letter agreements.\n\nThe number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in \ntrading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person \nin trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There \nare potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our \nnon-compete provisions. \n\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\n\nI expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of \ncontract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus \npool.  \n\nInvestigations\n\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\n\nAnonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I \ndirected the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the \ncompany decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with \nSally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of \nthe consultants\' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to \nemployees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]\n\nTexaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the \nTexaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent \ninappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation \nresults led to termination of employment for cause.\n\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\n\nI expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated \nfollowing PRC/bonus discussions. \n\n\nTraining\n\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\n\n Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works \nemployees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).  \n\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  \n\nEIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials \nGroup.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition \nof assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.  \n\nAll of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated \nearly next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher \ntraining is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went \nthrough the first round.\n\nPre-Hire Testing \n\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\n\nMany Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of \nscreening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development \ngroups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested \nexperts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests \nwill result in a successful employee.\n\nRe-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of \npotential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under \nBeth Perlman. \n\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\n\nI expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John \nLavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&A \nprogram.\n\n\nEmployee Relations/Terminations  \n\nMuch of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination \nissues -- approximately 10-15 per week (total).  No two situations are alike, \nand they require significant time.\n\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\n\nAfter PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.  The \ncompany will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on \na performance improvement plan.  Generally, I review those before they are \nput in place.  If they are not successful, then terminations are likely \n(probably early in the first half of 2001).  Those issues are time-consuming \nand full of risks.\n\nWork for Portfolio Assets\n\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\n\nEcogas:  wind-down issues.\n\nMariner:  Change of Control Agreements.\n\nCGAS:  harassment prevention training -- arranged for Littler, Mendelson to \nprovide training for CGAS personnel.\n\nEast Coast Power:  Agreements, advice and counselling on various issues.\n\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\n\nCGAS:  Revising employment agreements for key personnel.\n\nMariner:  Employment agreement negotiation.\n\n\nConclusions\n\n\nENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of \nmanager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has \nplaced processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement \nof an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of \nmanager or above.  \n\nSalaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).\n\nNet Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000.  \nI expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be \nmanaged out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling \nand documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure \nthat risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that \ngroup working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it \nmay improve over time.\n\nContractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the \nwork force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if \ncontractors are allowed to stay on too long.\n\nMisclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many \nemployees in the "exempt" category who should be classified as "non-exempt."  \nI have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will \nnot be an easy fix.\n\nEIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of \ntalent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle \ndiligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle \nthe job.  \n\nEGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other \ngroups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make \nretention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to \nshorten the non-compete duration for this group.\n\n\n', 1], ['Re: permanent employment .', 'text/plain', 'Gene,\n\nWhat is the status of the ProNexxus situation?

From my perspective, it \ngenerally looks fine.  I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add \nany he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.\n\nIn Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.  I \nbelieve this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be \nidentified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds \n$250K.    We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the \nprovisions of Section 4.13(iii).\n\nSection 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not \nrequired by law.  However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the \nfuture, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key \npersonnel to stay with the company through closing.  This may be done with \nthe Buyer\'s consent, but we may be tying our hands.  Section 6.2(e) contains \na similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.\n\nIn addition, Section 4.8 states that we won\'t enter into or amend any \nemployment contracts.  We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, \nand the contracts of key personnel may expire.  Do we want to tie our hands \nand be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?  Section 6.2(l) \nalso prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.\n\nIn Section 4.10, the wording "(other than Environmental Laws)" suggests that \nwe are not in compliance with environmental laws.  Rephrasing that sentence \nto refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.\n\nIn Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven\'t provided any gift of any kind \nto customers.  I don\'t think we can say that, given that we regularly host \nclient development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and \nprovide Enron goodies to people all the time.  Perhaps a limitation on de \nminimus gifts would be more accurate.  Also, a reference to our Code of \nEthics may work here.\n\nIn Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, \nor does it include equity grants that vest over time?  A reference to "cash" \npayments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock \noptions/restricted stock that vest over time.\n\nIn Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates \nvesting -- Pat, do you know?\n\nShould Section 7.3 be italicized?

What did he mean?\n   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up\n  your shorts. It\'s an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin=\nd\n  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you\'re going in, you probably ought t=\no\n  reevaluate your exercise program.\n\n   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis=\ne\n  program?\n   A: Can\'t think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No\n Pain.\n\n   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?\n   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If\n  you stop, you\'ll probably stress yourself to death in record time.\n\n   Q: Aren\'t fried foods bad for you?\n   A: You\'re not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In\n  fact, they\'re permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be\n bad for\n  you?\n\n   Q: What\'s the secret to healthy eating?\n   A: Thicker gravy.\n\n   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the\n  middle?\n   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul=\nd\n  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.\n\n  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.\n\n=7F\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\nShawn Shafai\nIT Project Manager, Global Extranet Management\nCisco Systems, Inc.\nTel:   408-525-4996\nFax:   408-526-7373\nPager: 800-365-4578\nmailto:sshafai@cisco.com\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n  <>  Empowering the Internet Generation  <>\n                Are You Ready?\n\n\n', 1], ['Spinnaker language', 'text/plain', 'George,\n I would suggest that the necessary language be added to the Special \nConditions block of the Transaction Confirmation.

Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get \na more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, \neven assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas \nload.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics \nusing about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis\' \nargument is going to be:  "I\'ll take the risk on building the pipeline and \nthe power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you."  \n"You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, \nyou will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or \nescalate, you lose."

If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly \nno.  We\'re shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the \ntariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to \ngrant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent \noperators and so long as we don\'t discriminate.

I can\'t remember which but its one of those) then the answer \nis the same.  \n\n2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the \nanswer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons \nfalling out as liquids.  I\'m remembering the catch all section of the Quality \nparagraph as prohibiting "dirt, gums, and other impurities that would \ninterfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah" or something to that \neffect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and \nheavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people \ndelivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no \nforce majeure.   I read Eric\'s very scientific email and I think the punch \nline was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The \nthing I can\'t remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. \nlimits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers \nare within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn\'t \nwork as good.  \n\n3.

Here\'s the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to \ntender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those \nreceipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines \nunbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that \nmake gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That \nlatter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should \nresell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell \nit there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was \nthat our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that \ngas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement \n(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the \ntransportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest \nupstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when \nECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than \nPermian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where \nthey wanted it.  I haven\'t confirmed that recollection but I am recalling \nthat we told Courtney that we couldn\'t just move our fuel gas around \nwhereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.\n\nIrrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct \nway to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers\' receipt \npoints.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes \nline pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of \nreasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move \nto the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage \nline pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, \nand sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. \nborder from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack \nback to optimal levels.  I wouldn\'t want to get into a pattern where we are \nconsistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line \npack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.

I called an old law \npartner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business \nthis week to have lunch and catch up.  This guy says he has come up with a \ngood formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap.  He\'s got an \n80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development \nin Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in \nservice on July 1.  Pretty quick work compared to other projects I\'ve seen.  \nHere\'s his racket:\n\n1.  He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained.  His \nUtah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from \nTokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in \ntypical electric utility gold plated style).  He didn\'t say, but I suspect \nthere is no warranty on the units.  Obviously, this isn\'t a bold new \nstrategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used \nequipment.\n\n2.  His siting/permitting strategy is to use "brownfield" sites--i.e., \nexisting industrial or utility infrastructure is there along with some \nexisting air emissions sources.  His Utah site is at the Magnesium Corp. of \nAmerica plant on the Great Salt Lake. Magcorp is an ex-client of mine and I \nknow it is a huge emissions source and has no Nimby issues.  Our compressor \nsites, in contrast, are not major emissions sites but may have some other \nthings in common with this strategy.\n\n3.  Here\'s a mysterious one--he says the financing is backstopped by the site \nowner (Magcorp in his project, potentially us if we do a TW project) but the \ncorporate structure he has designed results in the power plant being treated \nas a non-controlled, non-affiliated entity for air permitting purposes.  That \nmeans the power plant emissions are not treated as part of the same emissions \nsource as the host/site.  I\'m not sure how/whether this works in a TW \nscenario, but it might be worth looking at.  We\'d need to make sure that any \npower plant deal we chase doesn\'t screw up the timetable on the RedRock \nexpansion application at FERC.

I\'ll try to restate them, and add my initial \nthoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  \n\nQ 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  \n\nA.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were \ncertificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction \nis that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an \nalternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements \nfor the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won\'t know until the contracts are \nexecuted how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it \nwill be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. \napp., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given \nthe huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to \nsell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the \ncapacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a \ncombination of both.  \n\nQ 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options \n(to steal Jeff\'s term), like the following:\n 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or \nwhatever number we decide on)\n 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges\n 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah\n 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly \nthis option is not locked in and will float with TW\'s actual rate levels and \nfuel retainage percentages)\n\nA.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for \n1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve \nStojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated \nrate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach \ncould get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking \nour specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a \n7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I\'m not sure that would be \na bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a \ncustomer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for \nthe 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options \nof our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this is \nsticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure.  \n\nQ.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility do \nwe have in structuring the options?  \n\nA:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose \nto offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don\'t want to \nbe second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at \n$.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have \ndiscretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we \ncan slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better \ndeal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we \ndeliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by \noffering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and \n$.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to \nobtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.            \n\nQ.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???\n\nA.  Ideally, we\'d be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it \nthe way we\'d prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, \nDanny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d \nof offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That\'s 400 \nmm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want \noption 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That \nreally hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand \nfirst and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else?  \nPro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be \ndeemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may \nbe the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we\'ve filled the \nrecourse rate guys\' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the \nneg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective \nnondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh. \n\nSusan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered \nalready.

Assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the \ncurrent rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/KWh.  This is at the high end of the \nrange we hoped they\'d be in.\n\nAdditionally, DOE indicated that they need "redundancy" and don\'t want to \nrely on PNM for back up power.

We could tell Calpine "no" on their bid and hold them off for \nseveral months "negotiating" if that\'s what we thought would lead to the best \nvalue.  I don\'t personally think this would be a prudent approach, but its \nwhere our logic leads in the extreme, so we\'d better be prepared to explain \nwhy getting the bird in the hand from Calpine is smart.  \n\n2.  We\'ll research the question of whether we can reject any recourse bids \nthat come in over the next 6-8 months if we decide to hold onto the 60 mm/d \nfor awhile.  I\'ve thought about it a bit more and I\'m pretty sure you\'re not \ngoing to like the answer.  First, FERC says we\'ve got to have a recourse rate \nin place for all capacity, new or old.  One reason is that there needs to be \na max rate that applies to long term capacity releases.  We have the option \non new projects to go with the existing max tariff rate or a new \nincrementally designed rate.  We are going with the existing tariff rate on \nRedRock.  Fine, but that makes the existing rate the recourse rate for all \npurposes.  FERC\'s logic will be that TW could sell all of the RedRock \ncapacity at recourse rates (currently $.38) and never suffer a revenue \nshortfall even if future rate cases reduce TW\'s overall rates, because the \ncosts of all TW\'s facilities--including the new project--will be considered \nin the next rate case.  Think about it--our rates will only go down in the \nfuture if the ENTIRE cost of service goes down.  We\'d never "lose money" on \nRedRock, but we might not make as much as we could have made with an 15 year \nfixed $.38 negotiated rate.\n\nThere is another  approach.  We could have Mavrix submit a binding bid right \nnow for the 60 mm/d and just flat out sell it to them.  That would send a \npretty strong signal to the market that we are serious about deadlines.  The \ndownside of that aggressive approach is that it would get us into the same \nmess that El Paso finally got themselves out of, with Amoco, Dynegy and the \nwhole gang beating the crap out of us.
